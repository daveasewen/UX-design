# _LIVE-STATE — what's true now (cold-start spine)

*The supersession ledger for the project: what's **LIVE**, what's **DEAD** (don't build on it), what's
**OPEN**, plus in-flight **TARGETS**. Read this second, after `GOOD-MORNING.md`, before
`knowledge/README.md`. Per **ADR-0007**. ⚠️ **INTERIM — hand-maintained** until `_build_live_state.py`
generates it from front-matter edges + tombstones. Refresh at end of every session alongside the
handoff — and **stamp the date from `date`, never from the session's own belief** (the T-D12 handoff
mis-dated itself a day forward; commit timestamps caught it).*

*Siblings: **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`** — side-quests, feature ideas, resurrection candidates (the forward
half of the state machine, Dave's ask 2026-07-18) · **`_DECISION-HISTORY/`** — dated per-thread
narrative, relocated verbatim (how we got here; see its README for the rules + RESURRECT tags).*

## 🔀 SPIN-OFF LANE — Memento dream-pass (registered 2026-07-26, per the spin-off rule; runs COLD from its own record, deliberately OUTSIDE the GM queue — the lane itself dogfoods §4.2's cold-read thesis)
Entry point: `notes/2026-07-26-memento-dream-pass-scope-v2.md` (three shapes: Cowork · Claude Code · VS Code+Copilot) → v1 same date (§4.1 fields+gate, tooling verification) → `notes/2026-07-26-memento-dreaming-convergence-and-buildable.md` (the record).
**Status (2026-07-26, later session): D1–D4′ RULED + §4.1 BUILT.** Rulings + why: `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md` (D1a repo-side · D2 five values · D3 one script · D4′ §4.1→A→C→B; D5/D6 pencilled). Built: `knowledge/_capture_gate.py` (build/wrap/selftest modes) wired blocking into `_build_all.py`; runbook steps 1b/2/3 + gate section amended; cutover `notes/2026-07-26-provenance-cutover.md`; three lane notes field-retrofitted. **NEXT for this lane: Shape A** — scheduled Cowork task emitting `notes/_dream/…-proposals.md` (scope v1 §4). Owed: convergence-note `-v2` (still blocked on re-attach of `2026-07-26-convergence-anthropic-dreaming.md`) · Dave's D6 access check before any Shape C build. Prior commits `dfdc857` + `f140fee` + `d22f29f` (f140fee/d22f29f unpushed as of this session's start — Desktop push owed).
**Status (2026-07-26 evening, Shape A session): SHAPE A BUILT + FIRST DREAM PASS RUN — 8 floated proposals await Dave.** A-D1–A-D4 RULED (ledger, explicit option-select): manual-first-then-schedule · weekly/last-~15 (config only — task NOT created, earns itself on this file) · D5 ENACTED `.claude/agents/dreamer.md` (steering spec, single source for Shapes A/B/C; dot-path blocked to file tools → written via shell) · proposals home `notes/_dream/` — verified OUTSIDE `_capture_gate.py`'s glob, fields by discipline (A-D4). First pass: ONE cold Opus dreamer subagent, 15/15 transcripts read (turn-level ceiling held), evidence repo-verified → `notes/_dream/2026-07-26-proposals.md` (298 lines, 8 proposals ranked by prevalence; conductor spot-checked 3/3: P1 `_LIVE-STATE` 855 lines/205,561 B exact · P3 render-verify runbook untouched since 07-23, greps 0 · P5 ds-010 live at `Chart-bar.reference.html:102`, GM count 0). Dreamer also recorded a checked-clear list so the next pass doesn't re-open settled ground. NEXT: **Dave READS the proposals file** — promotion his alone (derivation-governance) → on his say-so the weekly task is created per A-D2. Owed unchanged: convergence `-v2` (blocked on re-attach) · D6 before any Shape C. Prior lane commits verified pushed at session start (`06e48ef` = origin/master).
**Status (2026-07-26 evening, ruling session): DAVE RULED THE DREAM — P1–P5+P7+P8 accept-enact-now (ENACTED), P6 deferred to its own session (parked `_FUTURE-STATE.md`), rejections: none; S-D1 schedule EARNED (`memento-dream-pass` weekly, Sun 07:10, per A-D2) · S-D2 lane flag (`--wrap --lane`) + S-D3 stdout-only wrap BUILT + bite-tested — both wrap-gate warts CLOSED.** Full rulings + WHY + enactment receipt: `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`. Headline enactments on main-queue surfaces (by ruling, per proposal): `_LIVE-STATE-ARCHIVE.md` (this file 205KB→62KB, ritual step 2d) · `knowledge/_git_commit.sh` + runbook · render-verify runbook fold · GM count/tuner/ds-010 lines · `_FUTURE-STATE` corrections. **Lane is now STEADY-STATE: the weekly task dreams; Dave rules; sessions enact.** Owed unchanged: convergence `-v2` (blocked on re-attach) · D6 before any Shape C. ⚠ `ec4c2f3` was UNPUSHED at this session's start — push the whole stack via Desktop.
**Status (2026-07-26 evening, weekly-run session): SECOND DREAM PASS RUN + RULED SAME SESSION — V2-P1–P4 ENACTED, V2-P5 HELD.** Pass ran cold per the lane checklist (Fable conductor + 1 Opus dreamer, repo-first forensics); 5 proposals → `notes/_dream/2026-07-26-proposals-v2.md` (commit `d777aaa`, 4/4 conductor spot-checks held). Dave ruled in plain language same session: V2-P1 six 07-24 chart deferrals RESTORED to GM §C·2 as **17–22** + compaction EXIT CHECK in ritual 2c/2d · V2-P2 emitter determinism FIXED (7 `sorted()` sites, 4 scripts; advisory 6/6 identical under random hash, §C·4 line closed; dated-banner mentions left historical) · V2-P3 ds-011 logged (G/H/N advisory promotions + triggers, incl. WCAG 2.4.1 Level A ×5 screens) · V2-P4 `_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md` fed 4 strands (legend v5.x · tuner v1+v2 · hit-area rule brief · 5 chart panes) + ritual step-1 feed-the-register clause. **V2-P5(a) ENACTED same session — Dave re-attached the note; saved verbatim to `notes/2026-07-26-convergence-anthropic-dreaming.md` (+fields, gate 0 fail); the three-session blocker is DEAD.** V2-P5(b) (runbook save-uploads clause) pencilled, awaits his word. Ledger rows V2-P1–P5 in `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`. Build 55/55 GREEN post-enactment. **Continuation same session (Dave: "love your work continue"): V2-P5(b) ENACTED (save-cited-uploads clause, ritual step 1; read as the yes, vetoable) + convergence `-v2` WRITTEN** — `notes/2026-07-26-convergence-anthropic-dreaming-v2.md` (Opus worker + Fable 4/4 spot-check incl. independent transcript grep; supersedes v1 in-part, v1 stays as filed; §3-verification fixes + databases-Q&A recorded OWED in its §7). **Lane's owed list now: D6 (Dave, before Shape C) + `-v2`'s own §7 leftovers only.** **S-D4 (same evening): conductor sequence inscribed → `knowledge/_RUNBOOK-dream-pass.md`; Cowork skill `dream-pass` + the weekly task prompt are thin pointers to it — "run dream pass" is now the whole invocation.**

## ⏱ LATEST DELTA — 2026-07-27 (Mon **evening #12**, OPUS solo self-conducting, effort MAX — ★★ **ds-018 ENACTED + CLOSED: A2 · B2 · C2, build 62/62 GREEN exit 0, commit `5cd91c6`** · ★★★ **C2's FIRST RUN FOUND THREE MORE SILENT-LOOKUP INSTANCES IN SECONDS** · ★ **the "B-D4 vs canon collision" DOES NOT EXIST** · ★ **there is NO GENERATOR for the chart CSS spine** · 🔴 ~72% at wrap) — "The class was never rare. It was invisible."

- **★★ ds-018 ENACTED.** **A2** `data/control/label-disabled` minted (light `#9D9D9D` `color/neutral/9` · dark `#808080` `color/neutral/8`), declared on the **light AND dark** spine blocks of Chart-bar/-combo/-donut/-line + mapped in each `#token-manifest`. **B2** `.dv-leg-reset:disabled` → `border-color:var(--line); color:var(--data-control-label-disabled)` — the border binds directly to `--line`, which IS B2; **the ruled accepted cost stands (identical borders at rest, label carries the distinction) — do not "fix" it back.** **C2** `knowledge/_validate_property_resolves.py` wired at steps 52–53. `--muted` ruled **no visual change** by Dave (*"muted looks fine to me"*), enacted as `--data-control-swatch-off:currentColor` — **a no-op BY CONSTRUCTION, not by measurement.**
- **★★★ THE FINDING, and it outranks ds-018.** Five instances of the silent-lookup class were found across five sessions, **every one by eye or by accident.** C2's first automated pass found **three more in seconds** ⇒ **the class was never rare, it was INVISIBLE, and every "instance N" count on the record is a FLOOR.** **(6) `--border-radius-default` — FIXED**: consumed by `.dv-legrow` in all four chart snippets, declared in **no snippet in the library**, fell to initial `0` = **correct in Mono BY ACCIDENT**, silently wrong in Console. ⚠ **a silent lookup can hide indefinitely behind a theme whose value happens to match the initial.** Fixed via the role token `--border-radius-control` (tier correction: a legend row is a control, not a surface). **(7) `--phys-size` — NOT FIXED, needs values**: Alert · Empty-state · Popover ⇒ **B-D7 press physics possibly DEAD in three components, on a RULED behaviour.** **(8) `--mark` — NOT FIXED, needs a value**: 7 pro-forma files, fills icon marks inside `<symbol>` ⇒ **falls to SVG-initial BLACK in silence**, the exact failure `Chart-bar`'s own spine comment documents for `--data-text-on-series`.
- **⚠ C2 IS ADVISORY THOUGH RULED BLOCKING.** 10 pre-existing failures on first run; clearing them now means **inventing values** (Dave's alone), and narrowing the glob to charts is **`gate-narrows-its-own-rule` in its purest form**. ⇒ rule stays WIDE, findings PUBLISHED, nothing faked green. **Promotion = `["--strict"]` on the build step, one line, when the worklist empties.**
- **⛔ RECORD CORRECTION — "B-D4 `#808080` vs canon `#9D9D9D`" IS NOT A COLLISION.** B-D4's **prose** says "both modes"; **its own `Values — SETTLED (Dave, 2026-07-20, dialled on the v7 live editor)` block gives the PAIR**, which `canon.css:351`/`:648` and `semantic-colour.json:1636` both implement. Three sources agree; the fourth is loose prose read against half the ruling. **Struck in place in GOOD-MORNING ×3.** ⇒ `trust-the-spine-not-the-prose`.
- **★ #11's CENTRAL INSTRUCTION WAS NOT FOLLOWABLE.** *"Land it in the GENERATOR"* — **there is no generator for the chart CSS spine**; `gen_component_partials.py` injects only JS behaviour blocks. The point held (canon.css is not in the chart cascade), the mechanism didn't exist. ⚠ **Second time in four sessions a handoff named a tool that could not do the job.**
- **Evidence:** `python3 knowledge/_build_all.py` **62/62 GREEN exit 0** · 2026-07-27 · `_validate_property_resolves.py --selftest` **green control + 4 bites + bite-the-bite, all PASS** · 2026-07-27 · censuses by `grep -c` over `knowledge/snippets/*.reference.html` + `knowledge/_proforma/*.html` · 2026-07-27 · decision doc `reviews/DS-018-VALUE-2026-07-27-v2.html` (+ `.REVIEW` overlay), **self-measuring — it leaves the three properties undeclared so the reader's browser resolves them** · commit `5cd91c6`.
- **⚠ AUTHOR FLAGS AGAINST HIS OWN WORK:** **instances 7 + 8 are static reasoning, NOT renders** — *"`--mark` falls back to black"* is precisely the tidy explanation **ds-019** punished. **Render-confirm first.** · **ds-018 is NOT render-proven** (deferred by ruling, env cold) · the value `#9D9D9D` entered on *"just do it"* = **assent to a plan, not a dialled number** · this entry was written at **🔴 ~72%**.
- **⬛ STILL OPEN, untouched:** C2's worklist (7 + 8) · ds-018's render-proof · ds-016 · the `CTRL` sweep (ruled YES, not started) · call (4) · ds-017's remedy · ds-012 · DV-D16/D18 · the 15-item ruling batch · the per-member behaviour opt-in schema question · **MEMORY.md compaction.**

## ⏱ PRIOR DELTA — 2026-07-27 (Mon **evening #11**, OPUS solo self-conducting, effort MAX — ★★ **ds-018's REMEDY IS RULED BY DAVE: A2 mint dataviz-tier · B2 label-led · C2 the wide fail-loud gate** · ★★ **THE SQUEEZE — the border channel is structurally unable to carry a recessive disabled state, and nobody had measured that** · ★ **the record was WRONG that `--text-disabled` has no `:root`; it does, at `#E1E1E1`, the exact value B-D4 was minted to escape** · ★ **chart snippets are not in canon.css's cascade at all** · review doc render-proven **30 checks · 0 failures ×2 widths, bite red** · NOTHING ENACTED, by his instruction) — "The remedy the record implied was impossible, and the reason was one measurement nobody had taken."

- **★★ RULED BY DAVE — ds-018 A2 · B2 · C2.** From `reviews/DS-018-DISABLED-STATE-2026-07-27-v1.html` (live specimens, three decision controls, contrast computed at render time). Verbatim: *"I've gone with your recommendations but we should probably wrap up and do it in the next window."* **A2** = mint dataviz-tier `--data-control-*` equivalents (siblings of `--data-axis`/`--data-grid`/`--data-series-*`, which already live on chart scopes) · **B2** = label-led (disabled label goes recessive; disabled border returns to `--line`, matching enabled-resting — **accepted cost, ruled with it: the label then carries the whole distinction**) · **C2** = the wide gate (*a declaration referencing a custom property that resolves nowhere in its own scope is a build failure*), the `fail-loud-on-unknown` shape already ratified for `dv-vocab`. ⚠ **C3 (the affordance gate) was NOT rejected on merit — it was not selected**; it stays a live candidate because it catches a resolved-but-wrong ladder C2 cannot see.
- **⛔ STILL UNRULED AND MUST NOT BE INFERRED — THE RECESSIVE VALUE.** The doc offered `#9D9D9D` / `#808080` / `#B5B5B5` / `#6B6B6B` **explicitly as candidates and explicitly NOT as a recommendation** (derivation governance: value promotion is Dave's alone). `#9D9D9D` was only the page's pre-selected preview. **The light/dark pairing is equally unruled.** ⇒ **Enactment must put the value to him; it may not read it off the ledger.**
- **★★ THE SQUEEZE — the finding that produced CALL B and was not in the record.** The remedy the record implied (*"make the disabled border recessive"*) is **structurally impossible**: enabled-resting border = `var(--line)` `#E1E1E1` at **1.31:1**; disabled currently resolves to ink at **17.40:1** ⇒ **the dead control carries 13.3× the contrast of the live one.** Anything quieter than enabled is below the perceptible floor; anything equal erases the distinction. **No third value exists, so the border channel cannot carry this state.** The label channel can — enabled label is ink at maximum contrast, leaving the recessive-but-visible band **B-D4 already ruled acceptable.** ⇒ **channel is upstream of tier, not downstream.**
- **★ THREE CORRECTIONS TO THE RECORD (verified from source, not inherited).** (1) **`--text-disabled` IS declared on `:root`** — `canon.css:350` = `#E1E1E1`, dark twin `#808080` at `:647`. The prior entry's *"zero `:root`"* was true of `--border-disabled` only and got over-generalised to both. ⇒ **"promote to `:root`" is already the label token's state, and it is a source of defect.** (2) `--border-disabled` census **confirmed unchanged** — 29 declarations, ten `.cn-*` form scopes + SC/dark twins, zero chart scopes, zero `:root`. (3) **Chart snippets link `type.css` ONLY and inline their own spine** (`Chart-bar.reference.html:51–52`) ⇒ **`canon.css` is not in the chart cascade at all, so a `:root` fix reaches a real app page and leaves the snippet — what every render-proof measures — broken.** ⚠ (4) **Value drift FLAGGED not corrected:** B-D4 ruled `#808080`; canon ships `--text-on-disabled: #9D9D9D` (`canon.css:351`) per the B-D6 fold. Both are ledgered, but they disagree, and it collides with the unruled recessive value.
- **Evidence:** review doc + `.REVIEW.html` overlay copy · 2026-07-27 · `knowledge/_render/verify_ds018_review.py` **30 checks · 0 failures at 1180 and 760**, licensed HSBC cut asserted **inside each measured frame**, transitions killed before every computed read, colours parsed and compared **as colours** · 2026-07-27 · **`--bite` red** — declaring the two properties on a COPY resolves the lookup and turns STEP 1 red, so the probe is not blind; canon untouched · 2026-07-27.
- **⚠ PROBE WART BANKED:** first run reported the enabled ratio as `11.31:1`. **The doc was right (1.31:1); the probe was wrong** — a `\d+\.\d+` regex over the table's *flattened* textContent straddled the adjacent `#E1E1E1` cell. **Read cells, never flattened text.** Also: the sandbox cannot `os.remove` under the repo mount, and a cleanup error printed *after* a correct verdict swallowed it — **cleanup runs after the verdict now, and moves to `outputs/` on the same mount.**
- **⬛ NOTHING ENACTED — Dave's instruction, and the gauge was Red (~66%).** No token minted, no gate built, no generator touched. The ruling is the deliverable.
- **⬛ STILL OPEN, untouched:** the ds-018 **recessive value** (his) · ds-016 · the `CTRL` sweep (ruled YES, not started) · call (4) · ds-017's remedy · ds-012 · DV-D16/D18 · the 15-item ruling batch · the per-member behaviour opt-in schema question · **MEMORY.md compaction.**

## ⏱ PRIOR DELTA — 2026-07-27 (Mon **evening #10**, OPUS solo self-conducting, effort MAX — ★ **DV-D17 IS RENDER-PROVEN: the debt from three sessions is DISCHARGED** · ★ **the old acceptance test was one-sided — an assertion of an ABSENCE, which a full revert also satisfies** · ★ **ds-018 RE-VERIFIED on a clean instrument and it STANDS — and the states are INVERTED, which is worse than reported** · build **60/60 GREEN**) — "A proof that only checks a thing is gone is satisfied by a revert; the missing half was proving it was ever there."

- **★★ DV-D17 — ENACTED · DOM-PROVEN · ✅ RENDER-PROVEN.** `knowledge/_render/verify_dv_d17_render.py`. Licensed HSBC cut asserted **inside the frame being measured**, transitions killed **before the first gesture** (ds-019's lesson, structurally), **real pointer clicks on the real gestures** (LABEL = isolate · SWATCH = check on) — never `classList.add`, which is not a user path. **Six contexts, identical:** snippet @1180/@760 · showroom **light** @1180/@760 · showroom **dark** @1180/@760 (verified genuinely dark — `--ink` `#FFFFFF`, `--line` `#808080` — so it is coverage, not one pane counted twice). **baseline** `rgb(225,225,225)` / `rgba(0,0,0,0)` → **isolated** `rgb(26,26,26)` = `--ink` + `color(srgb 0.101961 … / 0.06)` = 6% ink → **released** back to `rgb(225,225,225)` / `rgba(0,0,0,0)`.
- **★ THE FINDING — A ONE-SIDED PROOF OF AN ABSENCE IS NOT A PROOF.** The specified test was *"no `.dv-legrow` resolves the `.is-solo` treatment after isolate-then-check-on."* That is satisfied by a working fix, a blind probe, a mistyped selector **and a complete revert**. Session #8 ran it and printed `24 checks · 0 failures` while measuring nothing. **The replacement is two-sided in ONE gesture sequence: step 1 proves the treatment CAN be seen (isolate → it paints); step 2 proves it stops.** Step 1 is what makes step 2 mean anything — and it is precisely the half the original lacked. **Generalises past this defect: any proof whose assertion is "X is absent" needs a paired proof that X is detectable when present.**
- **★ THE BITE REPRODUCES DAVE'S SCREENSHOT.** `--bite` on a **neutered COPY** (216-byte DV-D17 release branch deleted; canon untouched, `git status` clean): step 2 fails at both widths with row 1 keeping `.is-solo`, `rgb(26,26,26)` border and 6% ink fill **while three series show** — the black-bordered "B Savings" Dave reported. **Step 1 still passes under the neuter**, which is the whole point: the probe is not blind, the behaviour is broken.
- **★ THE PROBE CAUGHT ITSELF, AND THE RULE IT EXERCISED IS THE ONE INSCRIBED THIS MORNING.** First run went red — *"row 2 paints an ink border with no `.is-solo`"*. **The check was working; the cause was the instrument:** `.dv-legrow:hover` also paints an ink border, and a **real** click leaves the cursor on the row it clicked. Fixed by parking the pointer **and** carrying an OBSERVED `hovered` field, so a hovered row is **named and skipped, never silently filtered**. *(A control that fires may be RIGHT — exhaust that before calling it broken. Here it was right about the pixels and wrong about the cause, and only an observed field could separate the two.)*
- **★★ ds-018 RE-VERIFIED AND IT STANDS — the timing defect did not reach it.** `knowledge/_render/recheck_ds018.py`, settled, pointer parked, 4 contexts: **`--border-disabled` → `''`** · **`--text-disabled` → `''`** · **`border-color` → `rgb(26,26,26)` = `--ink`**. ⚠ **AND IT IS WORSE THAN "DISABLED LOOKS LIKE HOVER" — THE STATES ARE INVERTED:** baseline (Reset **disabled**) → **ink border** · isolated (Reset **enabled and useful**) → `--line` · released (**disabled**) → **ink**. ⇒ **The disabled Reset is the most prominent control in the legend and the enabled one the faintest** — an inversion of affordance, not just a wrong colour. Cause unchanged (the lookup, instance five); **fix shape still Dave's**, and this adds a second cheap gate candidate: *a disabled control may not out-contrast its own enabled state.*
- **Evidence:** `python3 knowledge/_build_all.py` **60/60 GREEN exit 0** · 2026-07-27 · `verify_dv_d17_render.py` green ×6 contexts + `--bite` red ×2 widths · 2026-07-27 · `recheck_ds018.py` 4 contexts · 2026-07-27 · element renders `outputs/_render-env/png/DV-D17-three-states.png` **SEEN** (three legend states, licensed cut) · env staged from cold per `_RUNBOOK-render-verify.md`, **`__dirlock` EPERM appeared exactly as banked — a failure message after a success.**
- **⬛ NOT DONE, deliberately, and the price is stated:** no `_DECISION-HISTORY` dossier — the window ran to ~68% and inscription of the durable record was the priority over narrative. The two findings above are in the ledgers, which are the tattoos.
- **⬛ STILL OPEN, untouched:** ds-018's **fix shape + which gate (Dave's)** · ds-016 · the `CTRL` sweep (ruled YES, not started) · call (4) · ds-017's remedy · ds-012 · DV-D16/D18 · the 15-item ruling batch · the per-member behaviour opt-in schema question · **MEMORY.md compaction (its own small window).**

**(2) ASSETS — unchanged, and NOT a risk question.** Verified by inventory: **zero Latin
`.woff`/`.woff2` files exist in the repo** (five script packs present; Latin has none). A favourable
licence does not deliver files — shareable real-face material stays blocked until the pack physically
lands, because there is nothing to embed.

**✅ DISTRIBUTION — CLOSED, ruled "leave".** The four tracked files embedding base64 woff2 stay. No
`git rm --cached`, no BFG, no history rewrite. Repo is private (confirmed by Dave) and shared only to
HSBC employees — every recipient sits inside HSBC's own licence. Interim control retained:
`reviews/*CONTACT*.html` gitignored; share OUTSIDE HSBC as PDF only.

**WHAT CLEARS THIS:** (1) **files land** — `HSBC_MtUnivers_Latin-*.woff/.woff2` in
`knowledge/assets/fonts/` (this alone unblocks shareable material); (2) **brand confirms whether
Ultralight is in scope** — ⚠️ not a detail: the packs ship Th/Lt/Rg/Md/Bd ≡ 100/300/400/500/700, so
Ultralight is a **sixth weight below Thin → a change to the canon ramp → a TYPE RULING, not an asset
drop.** Expect it; don't discover it in a diff.

**Provenance corrections, kept loud (full record: `knowledge/_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`
§ Blockers 1):** I struck this blocker as "false" and Dave caught it. And
`WebfontUserGuide-2024.pdf` is **generic Monotype guidance, not an entitlement record** — "we hold no
Latin webfont" rests on absence of files, not on any document.

## LIVE — current truth (in force)

### ⭐ TYPE and BOX are SEPARATE — T-D12, RULED + VERIFIED across 21 files (2026-07-18)
- **Two lists, two questions.** `.t-cm-<size>` = TYPE (family, size, weight, **`line-height:1`**) —
  **safe to bind anywhere.** `.t-cm-slot` = BOX (`display:inline-flex`, `align-items`, `min-height`,
  cap-trim) — **opt-in**, bound ONLY where the element already declares a flex display.
- **`--slot` carries the slot height on the type composite.** A custom property is inert unless read,
  so a type-only binding has no box consequence. That is what makes the two lists independent.
- **`line-height` is TYPE, not BOX** — Component tier *is* "single-line at line-height 1". This was
  not the question the queue asked and it is the one that decided the batch: with line-height in the
  box, type-only bindings silently DROPPED the `/1` the old shorthand carried.
- **Cap-trim reaches elements that lacked it, and the shift is ACCEPTED** — refusing it would leave
  two classes of button in canon.
- **The slot test stays conservative.** "Already declares flex" is the OBSERVED condition `.btn` met,
  not a theory. **Slotting anything else is a per-component decision with its own diff, never a
  mechanical sweep.** Widening it is a ruling.
- Evidence: 13/21 pixel-identical, 0 page-height changes, real HSBC Univers. Ledger:
  `_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md` **T-D12**; sheet `reviews/TYPE-BOX-SPLIT-2026-07-18.html`.
  Validation state: **unaudited**.
- **METHOD, reusable:** the `NO_SNAP=1` isolation control in `apply_type_bind.py` separated diffs the
  binding CAUSED from diffs T-D10 INTENDED. **A diff you cannot attribute is not evidence.** Reach for
  a control before reaching for a verdict.

### Type binding — RULED + PROVEN on one component (2026-07-18)
- **Mechanism = (d) selector-list extension, HAND-MAINTAINED.** A component binds by being appended
  to its composite's selector list in `canon/type.css`. Plain CSS: no generator, no build step, no
  markup change. `type-bindings.json` + orphan gate = an OPTIONAL later upgrade, **explicitly
  deferred — do not build**. Ledger: `_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md` T-D9.
- **`.t-cm` is variant D.** Cap-trim sits on the **ELEMENT**; the former required `.txt` child is
  **GONE**. `inline-flex` + `align-items:center` centres the cap box in a taller slot — an
  `inline-block` variant TOP-ALIGNS and is wrong. Observed in real HSBC Univers. Supersedes the
  07-17 composite.
- **⚠️ LOAD ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.** `.t-cm-button` and `.btn` are both specificity 0-1-0 → source
  order decides. **`type.css` must load BEFORE component CSS.** Not yet gated.
- **Delivery = `<link>`, NOT inlining.** The portable unit is the PROJECT, not the file (Dave: *"the
  entire project must be portable… a package, pulled from a repo"*). The 49-file inline sweep was
  solving a problem that does not exist.
- **`type.css` is HAND-AUTHORED.** The "generated" header was false provenance; removed.
- **Bound so far: `.btn` (selector-list) + Countdown `.num` (CLASS).** **T-D14 (2026-07-19):** new rung
  `.t-cm-figure-3` (24px/500) added to the ramp; the countdown numeral is the **first composite bound in
  MARKUP** — via a class on the element, because bare `.num` can't go global (collides with `.cn-table td.num`).
  Zero-visual-change (500 = shipped value). **ASSERT-003 retired** (clears_when met). ⚠️ **The BULK binding
  mechanism for the remaining ~338 stays OPEN** — this was one collision-forced case, NOT a general ruling. Ledger: T-D14.
- **Unchanged from 07-17:** CSS cap-trim · 4px slot · slot min `ceil(cap + 2·descender)` snapped to
  4px · descender guard baked INTO the slot · stacks use `gap`, **never padding**.

### RAG — amber SOLVED, background/glyph split (2026-07-18)
- **Two tokens per hue: `background` (fills) + `glyph` (icons, arrows, text).** Red/green/blue hold
  the SAME value in both roles; **only amber diverges**. Ledger: `_proforma/_RAG-DECISIONS.md`.
- **`amber/background` = `#F0B13A`** — ink on it 9.16. **`amber/graphic` = `#C58900`** — 3.02 on
  white, 6.25 on `#111`; required by `{#dv-016}` (≥3:1 series fills, blocking).
- **Rule 1 — amber is always paired with black text. Rule 2 — amber is not a DIRECTIONAL delta
  colour**; it remains valid for status and tolerance.
- **White is the RAG text colour universally; dark-text variant DROPPED** (R-D1) — amber the sole
  exception, always was.
- **`#000000` retained in the KB as brand source of truth**; `#1A1A1A` = digital black for screens;
  `#1D1D1D` dropped; `#333333` canon, stays.
- **Incumbent RAG values NOT deleted** — retired into a future legacy theme. Tombstone, keep.
- **R-D4 (2026-07-18): matting rungs RULED — green + blue matted 15%** (`#2B7E4F` / `#306EC6`),
  red as-is, one level across both. **Role tokens PROMOTED** into `semantic-colour.json` as
  `rag/<hue>-background` + `rag/<hue>-glyph` (additive; incumbents untouched; zero components
  rebound yet — rebinding waits for the blast-radius gate). Green promoted **light-only**: the
  contrast gate refused the known-failing incumbent dark (3.37) — dark leaf lands with the
  dark-green ruling. Gate model gained `RULED_PAIR_EXCLUSIONS` (white text × amber fill is
  forbidden by rule 1, so the audit no longer tests it). Ledger: R-D4.
- **★ DARK SET LOCKED (2026-07-19, R-D5…R-D11).** Full arc: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-19-rag-colour-halation-ramp.md`.
  Dark-mode RAG (mode-stable for red/amber; per §note below for green/blue): **breach `#B92F1E` white ·
  watch `#F0B13A`/`#C58900` black · healthy `#43AD6F` black · info `#5F92B9` black** (cyan-shifted for
  astigmatic legibility). Weight uniform Medium 500. Marks icon/label-paired (never bare coloured text on
  dark). **Red = carve-out (deep+white, instability); amber = carve-out (lightness); green+blue = the
  isoluminant→RAMP-tuned pair.** Key rulings: R-D6 (halation = 3rd axis: bloom vs dance, thickness selects
  the mode; glyph-contrast-by-role) · R-D7 (red locked, weight polarity→uniform 500) · R-D9 (status colour
  is a SALIENCE RAMP, not isoluminant — loudness descends with severity) · R-D10 (set locked).
- **✅ LIGHT FILLS LOCKED (2026-07-19, R-D12…R-D14) — full set now reconciled.** R-D11 (fills are ground-relative)
  RESOLVED: **light green `#5DAC7B` · light blue `#7DABCD`** (H241, black text); dark stays R-D10 (`#43AD6F`/`#5F92B9`);
  red `#B92F1E`/white + amber `#F0B13A`/`#C58900` mode-stable. **NO lines** (R-D12 A, aesthetic); **black text on states**
  (R-D12 B). **Fill contrast = salience lever, NOT a floor** — the LABEL carries meaning (R-D6), so amber-soft-on-white is
  ruled fine (I over-raised it; Dave corrected). **★ Per-mode PROVEN, not asserted:** exhaustive search shows no single
  green/blue keeps green›blue on both grounds (loud=darker on white, lighter on dark). Reconciled table + arc: ledger
  R-D12…R-D14; sign-off `reviews/RAG-LIGHT-FILLS-2026-07-19-v9-LOCKED`; derivation `reviews/_rag_light_fills_calc.py`;
  ★ **two-mode in-browser TUNER** (v6→v7, OKLCh, ramp-guard) = Apollo Labs / Layer-2 controls candidate.
- **✅ FILLS PROMOTED (2026-07-19, this session).** R-D14 fills written to `semantic-colour.json` `*-background`
  + propagated to `canon.css`: light `#5DAC7B`/`#7DABCD`, dark `#43AD6F`/`#5F92B9`, breach `#B92F1E` now mode-stable,
  watch `#F0B13A`. `rag/text` polarity (white on breach, black on states — `type26-013`+R-D12 B) enacted via the
  **existing `RULED_PAIR_EXCLUSIONS`** (white×green/blue forbidden, like amber). Build green. **NOT rebound** — components
  render RAG as dots (glyphs, bind incumbents, R-D6 fine) + chips (tints); the `-background` fills await the §1
  manifestation pick. **Both amber rules still unenforced (gate owed).**
- **★ FOUR-THEME ARCHITECTURE — R-D15 (2026-07-19).** ONE token store + ONE baseline library, toggling **4 themes:
  Apollo Legacy · Mono · Console (UI) · Supercharge (SC)**. Components bind theme-agnostic roles; theme override sets
  supply the hex. **Apollo Legacy** alone carries the teals AND the HSBC brand `color/grey/100–800`. **The baseline we
  build now = Apollo Mono, "very mono": monochrome throughout, colour ONLY in RAG + data-vis.** Broader colour/theming
  build PARKED ("deal with colours later"). Ledger R-D15; memory `four-theme-architecture`.
- **★ Apollo Mono grey ramp = `color/mono/1…15`** (2026-07-19, R-D15). Dual-end brightness curve (γ=1.7, 15 stable
  index steps, black→white), packing resolution to both ends, thinning mid-greys; `#1A1A1A` = `mono/4`. Keys are index
  (theme-remappable); per-step brightness in the token `$description`. In `colour.json` + canon; build green. Tuner:
  `reviews/APOLLO-MONO-GREY-CURVE-2026-07-19-v2.html`. **Grey-tint standing check** (memory `feedback-grey-tint-check`):
  surface greys (`#333`=`grey/800`, `#767676`=`grey/600`) before changing — Dave usually rules black, but confirm.
- **★ Amount-display — P1 atom BUILT + gated (2026-07-19).** Money-format primitive: currency-before-no-space
  (copy-025), tabular figures, U+2212 sign, redacted privacy state. Snippet + `amount-display.meta.json` + review;
  monochrome (directional colour deferred to the colour workstream). Added figure rungs **`.t-cm-figure-4/5/6`**
  (32/16/14, all tabular) to `canon/type.css`; atom is fully composite-bound (no raw font). COMMITTED (conductor).
- **★ Digital black `#1A1A1A` = the new `#000`** (Dave 2026-07-19) — GENERAL, not just the reverse-text halation
  case. Swept all 38 components' dark grounds + `background/default` dark → `#1A1A1A` (shadows/overlays stay pure
  `#000`). COMMITTED. Expands [[neutral-blacks]]'s conditional framing; `#1A1A1A` = `mono/4`.
- **★ R-D16 — Mono semantic greys seated on `color/mono/*` — RULED, enactment PENDING.** Dave ruled on
  `reviews/APOLLO-MONO-SEMANTIC-GREYS-2026-07-19-v1`: text ink → `mono/4 #1A1A1A` (**★ SUPERSEDES `col25-011`**
  for Mono — Grey-8 stays Legacy) · **DROP** secondary text grey (hierarchy = weight/size, "very mono") ·
  `#767676`→`mono/8 #808080` · tinted `#D7D8D6`→`mono/12 #E1E1E1` · mechanical maps approved. **Enactment
  (Sonnet, queued):** write token values + sync the 38 component declarations + regen `canon.css` + re-gate;
  annotate `col25-011`/`colour-usage.md` with the Mono override. Ledger `_proforma/_RAG-DECISIONS.md` R-D16.

- **Project name = Apollo** (renamed from *Promenaut* repo-wide 2026-07-14; "Apollo" singular
  preferred, "Apollo SDS" acceptable). History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-14-rename-and-restructure.md`.
- **Red rule = red is the PRIMARY-action accent, used ONCE per screen** (RULED Dave 2026-07-14) —
  **NOT destructive-only.** Destructive/error takes a distinct, non-red treatment. Supersedes the
  charter §4 register-tied ceiling → now universal. `BRAND-1` gate rewritten accordingly.
  **Propagation gap (OPEN):** historical fitness-test builds + proof-001 `_GATE2-REPORT.md` still
  state the old rule — regenerate if revived. Memory `apollo-rename-and-red-rule-2026-07-14`.
- **Designer pack = shipped-ready** (2026-07-14). `designer-skills-v1/` (4 skills + built KB,
  gitignored); handover artifact **`Apollo-designer-skills.zip`**. Delivery via VS Code + Copilot
  Agent Skills; no Python for v1. Intro ~the 20th; hands-on the 24th. **Untested:** live-fire on a
  designer's machine — top release risk.
- **Working model = land to the live repo as-you-go** (RULED 2026-07-14). Deliverables write straight
  to the connected repo; the `/tmp/ux` snapshot is stale — don't trust it. GitHub Desktop CLOSED
  during Claude commits. Memory `working-model-cloud-vs-device`.
- **Repo restructured for human-readability** (2026-07-14) — root = operating essentials; visual map
  `docs/repo-map.html`. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-14-rename-and-restructure.md`.

- **Component library = Apollo pro-forma programme, in flight.** ONE component skeleton, N modes —
  **Apollo mono** (monochrome base; *"pro-forma" = Apollo mono*) · **Apollo UI** (branded HSBC) ·
  **Apollo SC** (prior branded — "keep the ideas, don't copy the solutions"). **FOUNDATIONAL RULING
  (Dave 2026-07-15):** no hardcoded styling — everything tokenised, sibling libraries governed by
  MODES; enforced by DEF-003 (no JS motion) + DEF-004 (no raw px) in `_build_all.py`.
  **Tranches T1–T8 built + gated** in `knowledge/_proforma/` (interactive one-file-per-tranche);
  rules live in `_PROFORMA-RULES.md` (16 rules, incl. rule 16: every component ships Swiss dossier +
  KB model doc). Reviewable build list =
  `reviews/ITINERARY-2026-07-14-apollo-component-library.{html,xlsx}` (124 items; ~50 real base gaps;
  extend-not-restart). Memory [[proforma-programme]].
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-15-proforma-tranche-arc.md`.
- **TYPE-TOKEN SYSTEM = PROMOTED TO CANON + grid enforced library-wide** (2026-07-17, Dave "crack
  on"): (1) primitives → `tokens/typography.json` + composites → `tokens/typography-composites.json`,
  `type.css` settled; (2) HSBC-general incumbent type+spacing parked as sibling sets — Apollo = the
  proposed HSBC standard, governed by modes; (3) **DEF-005** grid gate wired; (4) retrofit — 230
  off-grid snaps across canon.css + 38 snippets + 9 tranches; (5) vertical-stack rule drafted;
  (6) arrow asset RETIRED; (7) DEF-005 expanded to 50 files, all PASS. Rulings + WHY in
  `knowledge/_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`.
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-17-type-token-build.md`.
- **ATOMISE — build at the true atomic level, compose up** (RULED Dave 2026-07-14). Rolled-up
  patterns are a **debt**, not the model; build atoms → molecules → organisms per the `meta.schema`
  ladder. Known debt: decompose existing rolled-up molecules later. Applies to all new work.

- **Apollo product spine = "lovable on rails" · four phases** (Dave 2026-07-17; labels provisional,
  shape is the vision). **1 · Discover** (ingest/research; chat-to-KB bot likely here) ·
  **2 · Create** (being built now; four modes: **Strict** "Factory" · **Creative** · **Component
  Dev** · **Explore**) · **3 · Craft** (the review doc + comment overlay IS this phase) ·
  **4 · Dispatch** (hand to engineering; may fold away). **The four Create modes = TIERED LEVELS OF
  ADHERENCE** to the rails, guardrails progressively removed, per-tier sub-settings. **a11y (WCAG
  2.2 AA) IS the single non-removable floor** across every mode (per FOUNDATIONAL
  `accessibility-aspiration`) — "non-removable" = LOCKED, not HARDCODED: an **admin access layer**
  tunes every setting incl. the floor. **Apollo = the MOONSHOT** (name rationale). Memory
  `apollo-product-framing`. Unaudited — a framing, not a spec.
- **Product = a *flexing* engine** — one governed core, dials per work-type; floor/churn vs
  ceiling/novel. `ADR-0006`.
- **Output modes = a first-class dial** (Dave 2026-07-05): two fidelity tiers — portable dumb-HTML
  prototypes + build-ready from a prebuilt library, with **Sutherland** *a* target, not *the*
  architecture. Two-way tie: dark-mode work feeds INTO Sutherland; the Figma library IS Sutherland's
  working file. Memories `output-modes-portability`, `sutherland-figma-mapping`. Unaudited.
- **Register = an inference ramp** (NOT a look): sober = retrieve · balanced = extend · expressive =
  invent. Charter `_FIXED-FLEX-CHARTER.md` **§9**.
- **§9a — provenance of "reads HSBC"**: brand-ness resolves to named sources; flag-where-silent is
  advisory; residual gestalt = human. Record: `knowledge/_PROVENANCE-inference-levels_2026-07-04.md`.
- **Two harness modes** (§9a): converge/ship = mode B ADOPTED · explore/noodle = mode A OPEN. Memory
  `harness-two-modes`.
- **Project memory = temporal decision-graph pattern; this file is the cold-start spine.** `ADR-0007`.
- **Supersession discipline · git split · data hygiene** — canonical in `AGENTS.md` (tombstone +
  propagation log in the same pass; Claude commits in terminal, Dave pushes via GitHub Desktop only).
- **Build** — `python3 knowledge/_build_all.py` is the one command; the gate list lives in the script
  and in `GOOD-MORNING.md` §A. (This entry previously carried a third, drifted copy of the list.)
- **State machine records FUTURE/TARGET states too** (RULED 2026-07-05, extends ADR-0007): targets
  carry what · why · blockers · source; the staleness gate must flag a target whose blockers cleared.
  **Extended 2026-07-18:** the forward half now has its own home — **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`** (side-quests,
  ideas, resurrection candidates); in-flight TARGETS stay below. Unaudited node.

## SUPERSEDED / DEAD — do not build on

- `knowledge/_fitness-test/sme-payments-registers.html` — old looks-based register dial → superseded
  by charter §9 (2026-07-05). Tombstoned.
- Register-as-"described-look" — → superseded by §9 inference ramp (2026-07-03).
- Terminal-only push (07-02) — → superseded by the git split (07-05).
- `knowledge/_NEXT-SESSION.md` — retired → `GOOD-MORNING.md`.
- **`knowledge/_agent-memory/store/` — the memory mirror — DELETED 2026-07-18 (RULED Dave, via
  consolidation review pin 11).** It had become the third source of truth its own README forbids
  (115 stored vs 110 live, five ghosts, knowingly stale by three more). Final dated snapshot:
  **`_retired/agent-memory-snapshot-2026-07-18/`** (tombstone-bannered, non-authoritative, never
  refreshed). Capture-ritual step 3 amended: durable content is INSCRIBED properly (rules →
  guidelines/runbooks · checkable facts → assertions · rulings → ledgers), never photocopied.
  Propagation: runbook rewritten; snapshot README carries the tombstone; memory `capture-ritual`
  updated.
- **The "stale-reading pattern" spine note (07-18) — tombstoned 2026-07-18**, superseded by the
  **consult mechanism** (ruled via consolidation review pin 10): problem-domain index + pre-flight
  receipt, spec at `reviews/CONSOLIDATION-AUDIT-2026-07-18.html` §3, landing as
  `knowledge/_consult.py` + `_RUNBOOK-consult.md`. The bite-rule ("check the KB and the gates BEFORE
  designing") lives in `GOOD-MORNING.md` §A until the tool makes it mechanical.

## OPEN — propagation gaps + parked threads

### ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-19) — `gen_rules_index.py` truncation fixed
The `chunk[:500]` cap in `rule_text()` was cutting 11+ rules mid-sentence in `_RECONCILIATION.md` and making
their tails unsearchable in `_consult.py` (`icon-015` alone lost ~2300 chars). **Fix: cap removed** — the
walk-back already bounds `rule_text` to one bullet/paragraph, so full text now flows to both consumers.
Verified independently by the rules-index worker (465 rules intact, longest icon-015=2833, old-cap
fingerprint gone). Provenance comment in the generator so a cold session won't "restore" the cap. Receipt:
`notes/_receipts/2026-07-19-worker-rules-index-truncation.md`.

### ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-18) — the binding mechanism's BLAST RADIUS now has a gate
`_validate_type_blast_radius.py` (blocking, wired into `_build_all.py`) + registry
`canon/_type-bindings.json`. Bites on any UNREGISTERED / ESCAPED / UNWAIVED-BARE appended selector;
current debt registered + waived so it lands green. Full ruling + v1 limits: **T-D13** in
`_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`. Residual DEBT to burn down (non-`/1` batch): namespace `h2` (25
files) then the scoped-element set — tracked there, not here.

### 🟠 OPEN — the non-`/1` batch, and why DEF-006 stays unwired
**61 non-`/1` font shorthands remain in `snippets/`**; the bulk of the remaining **690 TYPE-002** sit
in the pro-forma tranches, carrying line-heights 1.1–1.6 — binding REPLACES them with canon and
**things move**. Needs its own reviewed batch with T-D12's before/after pixel discipline.
**DEF-006 is 780 → 729 and stays UNWIRED until this lands** — wiring it earlier trains everyone to
ignore a red build.

### Awaiting Dave — small, no analysis needed
- ~~Matting rung for green + blue~~ — **RULED R-D4 (2026-07-18): both matted 15%** (`#2B7E4F` /
  `#306EC6`), red as-is; role tokens promoted (see LIVE → RAG). Rung came from a direct readback —
  the pin export named the hue, not the row (the overlay row-identity debt biting again).
- ~~**`{#dv-017}`(a) CONTRADICTION**~~ **RESOLVED R-D5 (2026-07-19): split the clause** — directional deltas
  red/green ONLY; RAG status a separate concern (R-D3). Enacted in `data-visualisation.md`.
- ~~**★ RAG light-mode FILLS — REOPENED (R-D11)**~~ **RESOLVED + LOCKED 2026-07-19 (R-D14).** Light green `#5DAC7B` /
  blue `#7DABCD` (H241), dark stays R-D10; per-mode proven. See LIVE → RAG. **Only open piece: the token promotion**
  (`rag/*` per-mode + rebind behind the blast-radius gate) — Sonnet-appropriate, deferred.
- **§1 RAG manifestation — OPEN.** Which forms are canon: Status-indicator dot+label (existing canon) · filled
  cell/badge · bar/edge; tags+pills EXCLUDED by canon (ctkt). Decision sheet built
  (`reviews/RAG-STATUS-MANIFESTATION-2026-07-19-v1`), awaiting Dave's canon pick (A / A+B / A+B+C). Then a
  Sonnet build: rebind Status-indicator to R-D10, spec cell/bar as gated components (cells need more vertical padding).
- ~~**`.tag` COLLISION**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-18.** Was three things under one name: the tag component
  (14px), a smaller reuse (12px), and a masthead descriptor `.h .tag`. Ruled (Dave): tag atom = 3
  variants (dismissible/bordered/plain) × 2 sizes (`.tag`/`.tag--sm`), `.tag--plain` for borderless;
  colour/RAG deferred. Masthead descriptor renamed `.h .tag` → `.h .subtitle` (specimen chrome, not a
  component). Live Tags descender clip fixed via ds-005. Specimen: `reviews/TAG-COMPONENT-2026-07-18`.
  **ds-005 now GATED + CLOSED (07-19):** `_validate_descender_clip.py` (step 27/34) forces
  `text-box-edge:text text` on every truncating label; the button follow-on audit found `.btn`/`.cta`/`.qbtn`
  CLEAN (they never truncate — null result), the real debt was 7 labels in Tranche-2/3/4/7/8 + Masthead
  `.dd-title`/`.navitem-tx`, all fixed zero-waivers. Removing an override now reds the build.
- ~~**`.num` at 24px**~~ **RULED T-D14 (2026-07-19):** added `.t-cm-figure-3` (24/500) to the ramp;
  countdown numeral bound via class; build green (34 steps). Multi-size 20/24/32 lands with countdown size variants.
- **Family A (reverse on near-black), 12 decls** — held at 500. Re-specimen on a FULL dark surface.

### Gates owed — rules that exist but do not bite
- **Amber rules 1 + 2** (R-D3) · **type.css load order** · **DEF-006** (see above) · dark-mode green
  `#1AA05C` 3.37 · dark-mode red/blue as TEXT glyphs on `#111` (3.97 / 4.15).

### ⚠️ METHOD DEBT — the review overlay loses row identity
Three sheets needed three different disambiguation routes; one (RAG-MATTING) is unresolvable. **The
overlay should capture which row a comment is pinned to.** A PRODUCT fix, not a process workaround —
registered against the review-layer-as-product thread (and `_FUTURE-STATE.md` feature ideas).

- **🔴 GAP (2026-07-17, measured) — the library does NOT use the canon type ramp.** Type was promoted
  and the *grid* retrofit ran, but components were never rebound: **0 of 50** files reference a
  `.t-cm-*`/`.t-ed-*` composite; raw font declarations remain everywhere (canon.css 113, T8 43, T1
  25, T6 23…). **THE TYPE RETROFIT (sibling to the grid retrofit) — NOT STARTED:** (1) components
  link/inline `type.css`; (2) rebind every text declaration — Component for single-line, Editorial
  for wrapping prose (the N1 caveat decides); (3) snap off-ramp sizes; (4) wire
  `_validate_type_composites.py` into the build (Dave: *"we need to hard wire this"*).
  ⚠️ `canon.css` is GENERATED from snippets between the AUTO markers — edit snippets and regenerate,
  never hand-retype. Scope ≈ the grid retrofit; needs a fresh session.
- **✅ Icon SOURCE canvas normalised to 18×18** (2026-07-17, ruled option A — fix the assets, we own
  the library). Library now **652 × 18×18** + 6 deliberate non-square utility marks; build green;
  renders identical. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-17-type-token-build.md`.
- **🔵 SCHEDULED (Dave 2026-07-17) — ICON SCALE onto the 4px grid** (step 0 above done). Icon render
  sizes were never snapped and DEF-005's square-exemption can't see them. Measured: ~56 usages
  on-grid, **~50 OFF** (18px ×20, 14px ×14, 22px ×7, 26/34/11/15/10 tail). **The work:**
  (1) sanctioned icon scale on 4px = **12/16/20/24/32/36/40/44** (36·40·44 added by Dave — 44 = WCAG
  target-size floor); rule the mapping per off-grid size **against renders, not on paper** (Dave's
  call — optical weight); (2) **tie icon box → the type grid-slot** (icon beside a label takes the
  SAME slot — the rule that makes the scale self-evident); (3) source-artwork caveat: the ~71
  non-square assets need a `preserveAspectRatio`/pad-to-square ruling; (4) gate it — narrow DEF-005's
  exemption or add `_validate_icon_scale.py`; (5) retrofit the ~50, re-render. NOT started.

- **🟢 RULE 16 (2026-07-16) — component documentation is part of "done":** Swiss dossier in
  `reviews/` + graph-connected KB model doc in `_proforma/` (typed `relations:`). FIRM going forward.
  Exemplar: the Masthead pair. **Backlog (Dave "we might have to go back"):** retrofit docs for
  T1–T7; stand up the Swiss component catalog ("nicer Storybook") as their shared home.
- **🟡 PARKED — round-one DataViz kit BUILT + reviewed, "good enough for now", NOT signed off**
  (RULED Dave 2026-07-16). Gate-first: `_validate_dataviz.py` (9 blocking + 5 advisory) wired; whole
  kit on `knowledge/_proforma/DataViz-interactive.html`; **nine review rounds enacted** — ledger
  `knowledge/_proforma/_DATAVIZ-DECISIONS.md` (read before touching charts). **REVISIT target, not
  DONE:** Dave will add Layer-2 interaction controls (filtering, chart titles…) and finish sign-off.
  Interactivity never render-checked in a browser by Dave — needs his in-browser pass. Staleness:
  flip to DONE only on his sign-off.
- **DataViz foundations — RATIFIED + PROMOTED (2026-07-16):** method dossier ratified (semantic SVG +
  tokens + CSS motion + hidden-table spine; canvas rejected); **V7 promoted into
  `semantic-colour.json`**: `data/series/1–5` (C, mode-stable) · `data/series-high-contrast/1–5` (A,
  per-chart rebind) · `data/delta/{gain,loss,neutral,warning}` (D2, value-split pairs); **`{#dv-019}`
  recorded** (scoped gain/loss exception + the vibrating-boundaries rule, thresholds 1.25 / 135° /
  0.5 adopted advisory — quantified because Dave OBSERVED the dance on a 146° pair); suggestion
  ranges stay `proposed` in `tokens/_proposals/dataviz-ranges.proposals.json`. **NEXT = round-one kit
  revisit** per the parked entry above. Dossier: `reviews/DATAVIZ-METHOD-2026-07-16.html`.
  History (the rev 1→3 arc): `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-dataviz-v7-arc.md`. Presentation
  candidate: see `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.
- **🟢 Masthead — SHIPPED as an MLP** (review complete, Dave "done at last", 2026-07-16; MLP status
  ruled 2026-07-18). `knowledge/_proforma/Masthead-interactive.html`: one `.masthead`, 3 recipes
  (L1 exposed · L1 + mega · Trigger mega), drill-down drawer variant, all gates green. Supersedes the
  T7 `gheader` + `mm-masthead` demos. Two provisional glyphs (`i-brand-apollo` crescent,
  `i-menu-search`) await real assets — `knowledge/_ICON-GAPS.md`. Design revisit possible later.
  History (six review rounds): `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-masthead-rounds.md`.
- **⚠️ PROPAGATION GAP (partially closed):** `ADR-0006` + `notes/_VISION-iteration-machine_2026-07-03.html`
  still speak the OLD looks-language ("cool/warm/hot register switch"; the mock has a
  `border-radius:10px` cardinal violation). `_TEST-BRIEF-v2` §2 was reconciled 07-05; the vision doc
  + ADR-0006 remain open — do when next in that area.

- **Worked spread — DONE 2026-07-05, two instances (Sonnet + Opus re-run).** First
  retrieve/extend/invent spread; cardinal curbs held; Dave found two real gaps, fixed same session
  (canon rigour tier `.cn-*` > `.c-*`; Opus re-run). Writeups in
  `knowledge/_fitness-test/register-spread-2026-07-05*/`. Still not "proven" — one screen.
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md`.
- **🟠 GENERATION SHAPE — RULED (Dave, 2026-07-10): rule-tuning + inference tiering LEAD; the
  double-pass is a component, not the architecture.** The two-pass restyle was "not all that
  successful" — an interesting hypothesis, no more. Future state affirmed: **strict mode over a full
  component suite for the "factory"**. The trace tool (`knowledge/_trace_knowledge_usage.py`) showed
  governed output is already PURE-RETRIEVAL — tuning must change *what the rules ask for*, not
  adherence. **ROOT CAUSE of flat layouts: the library stops at organism — ZERO templates/shells** —
  the layout-governance gap and the library-tier gap are the SAME gap ([[library-composition-tier-gap]]).
  **OPEN DECISION F7:** build-upfront vs cluster-compound. **Working plan (agreed direction):**
  housecleaning → gap-analysis targets across three tiers (templates/shells = the load-bearing zero
  tier) → prove the loop on ONE cluster → build the template tier + compose gate → scale compounding.
  Full chain + all three hypotheses: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-07-s9-root-cause-and-ruling.md` +
  `knowledge/_FINDINGS-s9-session-2026-07-07.md`. Deep review:
  `reviews/REVIEW-2026-07-10-deep-analysis_rev2.html`. Memory [[ruling-generation-shape-2026-07-10]].
  **RESURRECT:** the experiment lineage is future evaluation material once the factory has all its
  parts (Dave, 2026-07-18) — registered in `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.
- **Named-not-built harness machinery** (§9/§9a): isolated generation · divergence probe (formal
  tooling) · mode-B brand self-check · the mode dial.
- **PM-KG MVP** (`ADR-0007`): `_build_live_state.py` + the staleness gate + `_capture_gate.py` — own
  focused session.
- **✅ Decision-corpus audit — TIER A CLEAN 2026-07-05** (ADR-0007 §5; method
  `_RUNBOOK-decision-audit.md`; ledger `_DECISION-AUDIT.md` — per-batch verdicts live there).
  Milestone: every Tier A node has a verdict — retires the "everything is unaudited" risk for
  foundational nodes. **Standing follow-ups:** §9 proof-obligation · ADR-0003 KG/ingestion · §4
  language-strip · TOV content audit · harness-modes exploration · re-audit the two amended nodes
  (ADR-0006, `derivation-governance` — amended text re-enters `unaudited`) · staged-promotion /
  extension-library process (direction VOUCHED, mechanism DEFERRED; tiered-access feature idea →
  `_FUTURE-STATE.md`). Next: Tier B opportunistically, Tier C by sample/on-touch. Never in a loaded
  session.
- **⭐ Harness modes + dials exploration** (from the 07-05 defer): flexible to a degree — clean
  switch or toggle + advanced mode, maybe "let it rip"; **finding the use cases is the important
  part**; research + iterate, start small. Own thread. Memory `harness-two-modes`.
- **⭐ TOV = digital-editorial spin-off + future content audit** (§4b defer): genuinely useful for
  DIGITAL EDITORIAL — candidate spin-off; for interfaces NOT a priority except neutral decisions
  (labelling, locale, formality). Memory `tone-of-voice-ingest`.
- **⭐ Charter §4 language-strip (HARD follow-up):** strip §4's interpretive prose
  (recall-by-adjective), leaving the four curbs as KG-sourced derivations — **do inside the
  unified-KG/ingestion thread, not standalone.** Amended text re-enters `unaudited`.
- **⭐ Unified DS knowledge-graph + ingestion, done right** (from ADR-0003 defer). The whole corpus is
  one interlinked graph; today that lives only in the compliance index. **Design direction (Dave,
  2026-07-10):** the compliance "KG" is an inverted index, fine for its job, wrong for the roadmap.
  When taken up: (1) **NOT GraphRAG** — overlay/property graph over existing stores, edge layer
  derived + regenerable, no monolith; (2) granularity = typed EDGES, not finer text (split only
  bundled rules — ACT atomic-vs-composite); (3) **import** the SC↔rule leg (ACT Rules Format 1.1 +
  axe-core metadata), hand-curate only component↔SC (our genuine novelty); (4) type edges
  `applies_to` vs `verified_by` — the queryable form of "enforced vs asserted"; (5) keep structural
  graph separate from advisory retrieval-over-prose. **Sequencing:** rides with the layout/library
  tier (R4) + Ingestion Phase 3 — not standalone infra. Cheap-now slice: type existing edges + import
  ACT. Memory `ds-knowledge-graph-revisit`. Unaudited.
- **Seaworthiness plan — DONE 2026-07-05** → `notes/_SEAWORTHINESS-PLAN_2026-07-05.md` (the
  dependency-aware sequence; partly overtaken by the pro-forma pivot). Phase 0 ingestion-tracking
  hygiene CLOSED same date. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md`.
- **D2 — novel-screen test — THE #1 unlock.** Waiting on a colleague's brief (their brief-v2 + own
  baseline + signed contract *before* generation). `notes/_TEST-PLAN-novel-screen-proof.md`.
- **Toolkit tranche 2** (Dropdowns ×4) — parallel cheap-model workstream. Memory
  `common-toolkit-survey`.

## PLANNED / TARGET STATES — in-flight targets (per the ADR-0007 extension)

*Intended end-states with a path. Ideas not yet in flight live in **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`**.*

- **🎯 Full consolidated review page (Apollo Mono baseline)** — Dave reviews the whole Mono baseline in **ONE
  big review page when the build-out is "done"**, not piecemeal (*"I just need to get this nailed"*, 2026-07-19).
  Running backlog + method: `knowledge/_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md` top block. Covers T1–T9 as they render post-tokenise,
  the tokenise deltas (divider `#3A3A3A→#808080` · blue focus · near-white primary), and the open decisions
  (mono primary-action token · success mono-vs-teal · focus blue-vs-mono) + DataViz sign-off + T9 first review.
  Memory `full-review-pending`.

- **🎯 Gates-as-a-service → close the agentic loop** (Dave 2026-07-14). Expose Apollo's validators as
  callable tools (MCP) so a host agent runs them mid-task (generate → check → fix → re-check) — the
  verifier is the expensive, differentiated half, already built. Removes the per-designer Python
  blocker. *Honesty:* the repair loop is not built; gates verify DECLARED obligations only. Memory
  `agentic-loop-gates-as-service`. Unaudited.
- **🎯 Chat-to-the-KB bot** (Dave 2026-07-17). Conversational agent over the Apollo KB (canon ·
  criteria · rulings · decision graph) for designers/devs/stakeholders. Open: retrieval grounding +
  citations, scope, surface, guardrails. **The consult index (2026-07-18) is its seed — same index,
  read side built once, used twice.** Memory `chat-to-kb-bot`. Unaudited.
- **🎯 Ingestion "done right"** — full detail: `knowledge/_INGESTION-ASSESSMENT_2026-07-05.md`
  (cockroach doc). Target: every ingested entity addressable in one overlay graph; tokens
  Sutherland-canonical, 147 deprecates retired; completeness = edge coverage. Sutherland export is NO
  LONGER a blocker (arrived 06-17). Path: Phase 1 token migration → Phase 2 finish guidelines →
  Phase 3 overlay graph (= the 07-10 KG design direction above) → Phase 4 wire coverage into this
  machine.

## SPIN-OFF / GENERALISABLE CANDIDATES — surface, don't bury (Dave, 2026-07-05)

*Tools/methods that may generalise — treat like company spin-offs. Surface mid-chat; don't force it.
Memory `spin-off-candidates`. Sibling register for ideas/side-quests: `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.*

- **🌱 The state machine** (`_LIVE-STATE` + `_FUTURE-STATE` + `_DECISION-HISTORY` + decision-audit
  method) — **Dave's first named candidate.** A portable "how a long-running agent project retains
  state, records supersession, and audits its own decisions" kit.
- **🌱 The FONT AUDIT instrument** (2026-07-18, `reviews/gen_univers_dossier.py` + fontTools passes):
  answers "is this face tight or loose relative to its own stroke weight; is our commissioned cut
  actually stock?" with numbers. Settled in ten minutes a weeks-open question and relocated a defect
  to the foundry (ds-004). Unruled; embedded in a dossier generator, would need extracting.
- **🌱 REAL-FONT EMBEDDING for review sheets** (2026-07-18, `embed_fonts()` in
  `gen_tracking_contact_sheet.py`): base64 woff2 inlining so specimens render in the brand face
  anywhere. Retired the "judge on your screen" caveat. **Candidate to fold into `_make_review.py`.**
- Other candidates (unruled): decision-audit runbook · fixed/flex charter pattern ·
  ingestion→overlay-KG method · review-dossier language-review instrument ·
  verification=enforcement gate-tiering · the cockroach-doc pattern. Precedent:
  `digital-experience-transformation`, `graphify-tool`.

- **Capture ritual** — canonical at `knowledge/_RUNBOOK-capture-ritual.md`; run every session, no
  exceptions. The enforcing `_capture_gate.py` is deferred to the PM-KG MVP.
