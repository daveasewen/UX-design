# _LIVE-STATE — what's true now (cold-start spine)

*The supersession ledger for the project: what's **LIVE**, what's **DEAD** (don't build on it), what's
**OPEN**, plus in-flight **TARGETS**. Read this second, after `GOOD-MORNING.md`, before
`knowledge/README.md`. Per **ADR-0007**. ⚠️ **INTERIM — hand-maintained** until `_build_live_state.py`
generates it from front-matter edges + tombstones. Refresh at end of every session alongside the
handoff — and **stamp the date from `date`, never from the session's own belief** (the T-D12 handoff
mis-dated itself a day forward; commit timestamps caught it).*

*Siblings: **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`** — side-quests, feature ideas, resurrection candidates (the forward
half of the state machine, Dave's ask 2026-07-18) · **`_DECISION-HISTORY/`** — dated per-thread
narrative, relocated verbatim (how we got here; see its README for the rules + RESURRECT tags).*

## 🔀 SPIN-OFF LANE — Memento dream-pass (registered 2026-07-26, per the spin-off rule; runs COLD from its own record, deliberately OUTSIDE the GM queue — the lane itself dogfoods §4.2's cold-read thesis)
Entry point: `notes/2026-07-26-memento-dream-pass-scope-v2.md` (three shapes: Cowork · Claude Code · VS Code+Copilot) → v1 same date (§4.1 fields+gate, tooling verification) → `notes/2026-07-26-memento-dreaming-convergence-and-buildable.md` (the record).
**Status (2026-07-26, later session): D1–D4′ RULED + §4.1 BUILT.** Rulings + why: `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md` (D1a repo-side · D2 five values · D3 one script · D4′ §4.1→A→C→B; D5/D6 pencilled). Built: `knowledge/_capture_gate.py` (build/wrap/selftest modes) wired blocking into `_build_all.py`; runbook steps 1b/2/3 + gate section amended; cutover `notes/2026-07-26-provenance-cutover.md`; three lane notes field-retrofitted. **NEXT for this lane: Shape A** — scheduled Cowork task emitting `notes/_dream/…-proposals.md` (scope v1 §4). Owed: convergence-note `-v2` (still blocked on re-attach of `2026-07-26-convergence-anthropic-dreaming.md`) · Dave's D6 access check before any Shape C build. Prior commits `dfdc857` + `f140fee` + `d22f29f` (f140fee/d22f29f unpushed as of this session's start — Desktop push owed).
**Status (2026-07-26 evening, Shape A session): SHAPE A BUILT + FIRST DREAM PASS RUN — 8 floated proposals await Dave.** A-D1–A-D4 RULED (ledger, explicit option-select): manual-first-then-schedule · weekly/last-~15 (config only — task NOT created, earns itself on this file) · D5 ENACTED `.claude/agents/dreamer.md` (steering spec, single source for Shapes A/B/C; dot-path blocked to file tools → written via shell) · proposals home `notes/_dream/` — verified OUTSIDE `_capture_gate.py`'s glob, fields by discipline (A-D4). First pass: ONE cold Opus dreamer subagent, 15/15 transcripts read (turn-level ceiling held), evidence repo-verified → `notes/_dream/2026-07-26-proposals.md` (298 lines, 8 proposals ranked by prevalence; conductor spot-checked 3/3: P1 `_LIVE-STATE` 855 lines/205,561 B exact · P3 render-verify runbook untouched since 07-23, greps 0 · P5 ds-010 live at `Chart-bar.reference.html:102`, GM count 0). Dreamer also recorded a checked-clear list so the next pass doesn't re-open settled ground. NEXT: **Dave READS the proposals file** — promotion his alone (derivation-governance) → on his say-so the weekly task is created per A-D2. Owed unchanged: convergence `-v2` (blocked on re-attach) · D6 before any Shape C. Prior lane commits verified pushed at session start (`06e48ef` = origin/master).
**Status (2026-07-26 evening, ruling session): DAVE RULED THE DREAM — P1–P5+P7+P8 accept-enact-now (ENACTED), P6 deferred to its own session (parked `_FUTURE-STATE.md`), rejections: none; S-D1 schedule EARNED (`memento-dream-pass` weekly, Sun 07:10, per A-D2) · S-D2 lane flag (`--wrap --lane`) + S-D3 stdout-only wrap BUILT + bite-tested — both wrap-gate warts CLOSED.** Full rulings + WHY + enactment receipt: `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`. Headline enactments on main-queue surfaces (by ruling, per proposal): `_LIVE-STATE-ARCHIVE.md` (this file 205KB→62KB, ritual step 2d) · `knowledge/_git_commit.sh` + runbook · render-verify runbook fold · GM count/tuner/ds-010 lines · `_FUTURE-STATE` corrections. **Lane is now STEADY-STATE: the weekly task dreams; Dave rules; sessions enact.** Owed unchanged: convergence `-v2` (blocked on re-attach) · D6 before any Shape C. ⚠ `ec4c2f3` was UNPUSHED at this session's start — push the whole stack via Desktop.
**Status (2026-07-26 evening, weekly-run session): SECOND DREAM PASS RUN + RULED SAME SESSION — V2-P1–P4 ENACTED, V2-P5 HELD.** Pass ran cold per the lane checklist (Fable conductor + 1 Opus dreamer, repo-first forensics); 5 proposals → `notes/_dream/2026-07-26-proposals-v2.md` (commit `d777aaa`, 4/4 conductor spot-checks held). Dave ruled in plain language same session: V2-P1 six 07-24 chart deferrals RESTORED to GM §C·2 as **17–22** + compaction EXIT CHECK in ritual 2c/2d · V2-P2 emitter determinism FIXED (7 `sorted()` sites, 4 scripts; advisory 6/6 identical under random hash, §C·4 line closed; dated-banner mentions left historical) · V2-P3 ds-011 logged (G/H/N advisory promotions + triggers, incl. WCAG 2.4.1 Level A ×5 screens) · V2-P4 `_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md` fed 4 strands (legend v5.x · tuner v1+v2 · hit-area rule brief · 5 chart panes) + ritual step-1 feed-the-register clause. **V2-P5(a) ENACTED same session — Dave re-attached the note; saved verbatim to `notes/2026-07-26-convergence-anthropic-dreaming.md` (+fields, gate 0 fail); the three-session blocker is DEAD.** V2-P5(b) (runbook save-uploads clause) pencilled, awaits his word. Ledger rows V2-P1–P5 in `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`. Build 55/55 GREEN post-enactment. **Continuation same session (Dave: "love your work continue"): V2-P5(b) ENACTED (save-cited-uploads clause, ritual step 1; read as the yes, vetoable) + convergence `-v2` WRITTEN** — `notes/2026-07-26-convergence-anthropic-dreaming-v2.md` (Opus worker + Fable 4/4 spot-check incl. independent transcript grep; supersedes v1 in-part, v1 stays as filed; §3-verification fixes + databases-Q&A recorded OWED in its §7). **Lane's owed list — CORRECTED 2026-07-28 #22 (dream-pass-3 P4a; the 07-26 'only' was false within a day): the ledger `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md` is the owed list's home, never this line — at correction time it held: M12's first unattended Sunday fire (08-02 07:10; M11 CLOSED #21 `0ee1634`) · D6 (Dave, before Shape C) · `-v2`'s §7 leftovers · the #21 dreamer hunt-list follow-ons.** **S-D4 (same evening): conductor sequence inscribed → `knowledge/_RUNBOOK-dream-pass.md`; Cowork skill `dream-pass` + the weekly task prompt are thin pointers to it — "run dream pass" is now the whole invocation.**
**Status (2026-08-08, dream pass 5 — the lane's first §🔀 row since 2026-07-26, and that gap is the finding): PASS 5 RAN MANUALLY, OVERDUE FROM #127. 3 proposals; P1 + P2 RULED SAME SESSION; ALL SEVEN 2026-08-02 ITEMS RULED ENACT-NOW.** Run shape: **manual**, not the scheduled fire — it was raised by Dave mid-#127, did not fit that window, and was **rolled to #128 as item ①** rather than started and abandoned. Dreamer = Opus pinned, conductor = Fable, spot-checks **4/4 held**. Output `notes/_dream/2026-08-08-proposals.md`, commit `6836c5a` — **P1** (all six 2026-08-02 dream-pass rulings unenacted at #127 **and none of them present in `_rulings.json`**, so the instrument that tracks enactment was structurally blind to them) · **P2** (residual carry rolled 14×, no age on any carried item) · **P3** (this file's own sweep risk); 5 checked-clear. **Dave ruled P1 and P2 the same session, and extended P1 live** from *register the six for visibility* to **enact all seven 08-02 items now** (`s128-D1`); P2 ruled as an age-bracket FORMAT, no threshold and no gate (`s128-D2`); and two seams were ruled alongside — **this very step** (`s128-D3`, the lane writes its status here between commit and gate, `knowledge/_RUNBOOK-dream-pass.md` step 7b) and the commit script's `--cleanup=verbatim` + subject assert (`s128-D4`, raised by pass 5's own first commit losing its message to a '#'-leading first line). Rulings + WHY: `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md` § #128; registrations `d0802-P2a…P7` in `knowledge/_rulings.json`. **Lane state: steady, and the third clause of its charter — *sessions enact* — has a receipt for the first time in 52 sessions.**

**Landed (evidence per claim):**

- **① ✅ `s132-D1` — RULED AND ENACTED.** Dave ruled from `reviews/INFO-BLUE-CONTROLLER-2026-08-08-s132-v1.html` via its own export, confirmed firm on readback INCLUDING the mark flip: fill `#5A85C1`, mark INK `#1A1A1A` **4.61:1**; white/fill 3.78 · fill vs `#FFFFFF` 3.78 · fill vs `#1A1A1A` 4.61 — conductor-reproduced independently before inscription. One RAG map, mode-invariant; `s122-D3`'s information VALUE and MARK superseded, structure kept. Authority: `knowledge/_rulings.json` § `s132-D1`.
- **② ✅ SPINE.** `apollo-console.overrides.json` + `apollo-supercharge.overrides.json`: 6 value slots ×2 themes → `#5A85C1`, `marks.info` → `#1A1A1A`, console tint re-composited `#D1DDEE`/`#364963` at the s123-D3 ruled alphas; `_themes.json` 3 provenance notes amended BY ADDITION. ★ **THE CATCH:** the first patch re-composited SC's tints too — but SC tints are **SOLID pins** (s123-D3: *"the warm ramp can stay solids"*), re-hue is a **separate unruled call** — REVERTED in-window to `#D6E3EC`/`#092131` before commit, clause quoted in the note. The fall-through class, caught by reading the note it would have overwritten.
- **③ ✅ REGEN + GATES.** `gen_canon_tokens` 541 vars · `gen_theme_cascade` 201/206 `--check` rc=0 · `gen_canon_components` 75 no change; canon.css holds 40× `#5A85C1`, 0× `#4F77B0`. `_governs --selftest` rc=0.
- **④ ✅ RENDER-PROOF, CONDUCTOR-VIEWED.** `reviews/CONSOLE-SC-INFO-BLUE-2026-08-08-s132-v1.html` — 24/24 computed assertions EXACT (2 themes × 2 modes × 3 values × 2 widths), HSBC face, crop viewed. Registered in `knowledge/_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md`. Pothole datapoints: `$HOME` volume 100% FULL (mkdir failed) — full `/var/tmp` rehome incl. `HOME=` and `pip --target`; a partial ENOSPC pip install left a broken `playwright` package needing force-reinstall.
- **⚠ ⑤ THE GLOSS/RECORD MISMATCH — DECLARED.** The #131 chain's *"two console/SC information-REST items"* resolves to **NO record** in `_STATE-CONTRAST-AUDIT.md` (no line names information). A Banner-scoped re-run on the enacted bytes reproduced ONLY the 4 known 4.09 pressed fails (`s130-D4` territory, untouched); the standing audit was backed up and byte-restored after the filtered run. The white-on-info worry is dissolved ARITHMETICALLY by the mark flip (ink 4.61 at REST) — but no named record existed to close, and none was invented.
- **⚠ ⑥ `s131-D2` REPAIRED BY ADDITION.** Found inscribed post-wrap (commit `e4d2796`) with no `evidence` field — `_governs` RED on committed bytes. Ledger section written LATE at #132 (declared as late), evidence pointed at it, status amended by addition. **Its enactment (KG robustness to the Memento standard) remains OPEN and is the #133 headline candidate.**
- **✅ ⑦ QUOTA PANEL GIVEN:** session 12% · weekly all-models 21% · weekly Fable 24% (reset Thu 22:59). The #131/#130 unknown is CLOSED.
- **⚙ Gauge:** boot **55,654 real — the TENTH datapoint, INSIDE the band 54,859 ±1,178**. Wrap opened at FILL **145,360** vs stop line 150,929 — ✅ BELOW the line. Delegation: NONE (fill bound the window; quota was comfortable once known).
- **→ #133:** ⬛ **① `s131-D2` enactment — the KG index/parse-gate/checklist build [1]** · ⬛ **② remainder of `s130-D4`/`D5`/`D6` + tabs [3]** · ⬛ **③ ERROR-MARK image confirm — STILL OWED [3]** · ⬛ **④ mark-vs-fill 3.0 gate — DAVE'S [3]** · ⬛ **⑤ `_validate_state_contrast --selftest` env-dependence named refusal [3]** · ⬛ **⑥ carried set from #130 [18th roll]**.


## 🕓 OPEN — Latin Univers **WEBFONT**: waiting on brand (raised 2026-07-18, reframed same week)

> **DOWNGRADED from ⛔ BLOCKING to 🕓 WAITING.** Dave: *"the license will be renewed soon, it may well
> have been already, the webfont needed Ultralight added, I think this is only procedural, and low
> risk."* **The commercial judgement is his and recorded as made — do not re-litigate it.**

**Split the question in two. Only one half is about risk.**

**(1) LICENCE — procedural, pending, low-risk. Owner: BRAND, chased by Dave.** The renewal is in
flight; the delta is a *weight* (**Ultralight**) being added. Write **"renewal pending; Dave assesses
the gap as procedural and low-risk"** — never "we have no licence".

**(2) ASSETS — unchanged, and NOT a risk question.** Verified by inventory: **zero Latin
`.woff`/`.woff2` files exist in the repo** (five script packs present; Latin has none). A favourable
licence does not deliver files — shareable real-face material stays blocked until the pack physically
lands, because there is nothing to embed.

**✅ DISTRIBUTION — CLOSED, ruled "leave".** The four tracked files embedding base64 woff2 stay. No
`git rm --cached`, no BFG, no history rewrite. Repo is private (confirmed by Dave) and shared only to
HSBC employees — every recipient sits inside HSBC's own licence. Interim control retained:
`reviews/*CONTACT*.html` gitignored; share OUTSIDE HSBC as PDF only.

**WHAT CLEARS THIS:** (1) **files land** — `HSBC_MtUnivers_Latin-*.woff/.woff2` in
`knowledge/assets/fonts/` (this alone unblocks shareable material); (2) **brand confirms whether
Ultralight is in scope** — ⚠️ not a detail: the packs ship Th/Lt/Rg/Md/Bd ≡ 100/300/400/500/700, so
Ultralight is a **sixth weight below Thin → a change to the canon ramp → a TYPE RULING, not an asset
drop.** Expect it; don't discover it in a diff.

**Provenance corrections, kept loud (full record: `knowledge/_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`
§ Blockers 1):** I struck this blocker as "false" and Dave caught it. And
`WebfontUserGuide-2024.pdf` is **generic Monotype guidance, not an entitlement record** — "we hold no
Latin webfont" rests on absence of files, not on any document.

## LIVE — current truth (in force)

### ⭐ TYPE and BOX are SEPARATE — T-D12, RULED + VERIFIED across 21 files (2026-07-18)
- **Two lists, two questions.** `.t-cm-<size>` = TYPE (family, size, weight, **`line-height:1`**) —
  **safe to bind anywhere.** `.t-cm-slot` = BOX (`display:inline-flex`, `align-items`, `min-height`,
  cap-trim) — **opt-in**, bound ONLY where the element already declares a flex display.
- **`--slot` carries the slot height on the type composite.** A custom property is inert unless read,
  so a type-only binding has no box consequence. That is what makes the two lists independent.
- **`line-height` is TYPE, not BOX** — Component tier *is* "single-line at line-height 1". This was
  not the question the queue asked and it is the one that decided the batch: with line-height in the
  box, type-only bindings silently DROPPED the `/1` the old shorthand carried.
- **Cap-trim reaches elements that lacked it, and the shift is ACCEPTED** — refusing it would leave
  two classes of button in canon.
- **The slot test stays conservative.** "Already declares flex" is the OBSERVED condition `.btn` met,
  not a theory. **Slotting anything else is a per-component decision with its own diff, never a
  mechanical sweep.** Widening it is a ruling.
- Evidence: 13/21 pixel-identical, 0 page-height changes, real HSBC Univers. Ledger:
  `_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md` **T-D12**; sheet `reviews/TYPE-BOX-SPLIT-2026-07-18.html`.
  Validation state: **unaudited**.
- **METHOD, reusable:** the `NO_SNAP=1` isolation control in `apply_type_bind.py` separated diffs the
  binding CAUSED from diffs T-D10 INTENDED. **A diff you cannot attribute is not evidence.** Reach for
  a control before reaching for a verdict.

### Type binding — RULED + PROVEN on one component (2026-07-18)
- **Mechanism = (d) selector-list extension, HAND-MAINTAINED.** A component binds by being appended
  to its composite's selector list in `canon/type.css`. Plain CSS: no generator, no build step, no
  markup change. `type-bindings.json` + orphan gate = an OPTIONAL later upgrade, **explicitly
  deferred — do not build**. Ledger: `_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md` T-D9.
- **`.t-cm` is variant D.** Cap-trim sits on the **ELEMENT**; the former required `.txt` child is
  **GONE**. `inline-flex` + `align-items:center` centres the cap box in a taller slot — an
  `inline-block` variant TOP-ALIGNS and is wrong. Observed in real HSBC Univers. Supersedes the
  07-17 composite.
- **⚠️ LOAD ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.** `.t-cm-button` and `.btn` are both specificity 0-1-0 → source
  order decides. **`type.css` must load BEFORE component CSS.** Not yet gated.
- **Delivery = `<link>`, NOT inlining.** The portable unit is the PROJECT, not the file (Dave: *"the
  entire project must be portable… a package, pulled from a repo"*). The 49-file inline sweep was
  solving a problem that does not exist.
- **`type.css` is HAND-AUTHORED.** The "generated" header was false provenance; removed.
- **Bound so far: `.btn` (selector-list) + Countdown `.num` (CLASS).** **T-D14 (2026-07-19):** new rung
  `.t-cm-figure-3` (24px/500) added to the ramp; the countdown numeral is the **first composite bound in
  MARKUP** — via a class on the element, because bare `.num` can't go global (collides with `.cn-table td.num`).
  Zero-visual-change (500 = shipped value). **ASSERT-003 retired** (clears_when met). ⚠️ **The BULK binding
  mechanism for the remaining ~338 stays OPEN** — this was one collision-forced case, NOT a general ruling. Ledger: T-D14.
- **Unchanged from 07-17:** CSS cap-trim · 4px slot · slot min `ceil(cap + 2·descender)` snapped to
  4px · descender guard baked INTO the slot · stacks use `gap`, **never padding**.

### RAG — amber SOLVED, background/glyph split (2026-07-18)
- **Two tokens per hue: `background` (fills) + `glyph` (icons, arrows, text).** Red/green/blue hold
  the SAME value in both roles; **only amber diverges**. Ledger: `_proforma/_RAG-DECISIONS.md`.
- **`amber/background` = `#F0B13A`** — ink on it 9.16. **`amber/graphic` = `#C58900`** — 3.02 on
  white, 6.25 on `#111`; required by `{#dv-016}` (≥3:1 series fills, blocking).
- **Rule 1 — amber is always paired with black text. Rule 2 — amber is not a DIRECTIONAL delta
  colour**; it remains valid for status and tolerance.
- **White is the RAG text colour universally; dark-text variant DROPPED** (R-D1, claim carried live
  by R-D7/R-D15 — cite those; R-D1 itself is superseded · s124 tally SAVE) — amber the sole
  exception, always was.
- **`#000000` retained in the KB as brand source of truth**; `#1A1A1A` = digital black for screens;
  `#1D1D1D` dropped; `#333333` canon, stays.
- **Incumbent RAG values NOT deleted** — retired into a future legacy theme. Tombstone, keep.
- **R-D4 (2026-07-18): matting rungs RULED — green + blue matted 15%** (`#2B7E4F` / `#306EC6` —
  ⚠ SUPERSEDED as fill values (R-D12.B): light later RESOLVED `#5DAC7B`/`#7DABCD`, dark stays
  R-D10's `#43AD6F`/`#5F92B9`, see below · s124 tally SAVE),
  red as-is, one level across both. **Role tokens PROMOTED** into `semantic-colour.json` as
  `rag/<hue>-background` + `rag/<hue>-glyph` (additive; incumbents untouched; zero components
  rebound yet — rebinding waits for the blast-radius gate). Green promoted **light-only**: the
  contrast gate refused the known-failing incumbent dark (3.37) — dark leaf lands with the
  dark-green ruling. Gate model gained `RULED_PAIR_EXCLUSIONS` (white text × amber fill is
  forbidden by rule 1, so the audit no longer tests it). Ledger: R-D4.
- **★ DARK SET LOCKED (2026-07-19, R-D5…R-D11).** Full arc: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-19-rag-colour-halation-ramp.md`.
  Dark-mode RAG (mode-stable for red/amber; per §note below for green/blue): **breach `#B92F1E` white ·
  watch `#F0B13A`/`#C58900` black · healthy `#43AD6F` black · info `#5F92B9` black** (cyan-shifted for
  astigmatic legibility). Weight uniform Medium 500. Marks icon/label-paired (never bare coloured text on
  dark). **Red = carve-out (deep+white, instability); amber = carve-out (lightness); green+blue = the
  isoluminant→RAMP-tuned pair.** Key rulings: R-D6 (halation = 3rd axis: bloom vs dance, thickness selects
  the mode; glyph-contrast-by-role) · R-D7 (red locked, weight polarity→uniform 500) · R-D9 (status colour
  is a SALIENCE RAMP, not isoluminant — loudness descends with severity) · R-D10 (set locked).
- **✅ LIGHT FILLS LOCKED (2026-07-19, R-D12…R-D14) — full set now reconciled.** R-D11 (fills are ground-relative)
  RESOLVED: **light green `#5DAC7B` · light blue `#7DABCD`** (H241, black text); dark stays R-D10 (`#43AD6F`/`#5F92B9`);
  red `#B92F1E`/white + amber `#F0B13A`/`#C58900` mode-stable. **NO lines** (R-D12 A, aesthetic); **black text on states**
  (R-D12 B). **Fill contrast = salience lever, NOT a floor** — the LABEL carries meaning (R-D6), so amber-soft-on-white is
  ruled fine (I over-raised it; Dave corrected). **★ Per-mode PROVEN, not asserted:** exhaustive search shows no single
  green/blue keeps green›blue on both grounds (loud=darker on white, lighter on dark). Reconciled table + arc: ledger
  R-D12…R-D14; sign-off `reviews/RAG-LIGHT-FILLS-2026-07-19-v9-LOCKED`; derivation `reviews/_rag_light_fills_calc.py`;
  ★ **two-mode in-browser TUNER** (v6→v7, OKLCh, ramp-guard) = Apollo Labs / Layer-2 controls candidate.
- **✅ FILLS PROMOTED (2026-07-19, this session).** R-D14 fills written to `semantic-colour.json` `*-background`
  + propagated to `canon.css`: light `#5DAC7B`/`#7DABCD`, dark `#43AD6F`/`#5F92B9`, breach `#B92F1E` now mode-stable,
  watch `#F0B13A`. `rag/text` polarity (white on breach, black on states — `type26-013`+R-D12 B) enacted via the
  **existing `RULED_PAIR_EXCLUSIONS`** (white×green/blue forbidden, like amber). Build green. **NOT rebound** — components
  render RAG as dots (glyphs, bind incumbents, R-D6 fine) + chips (tints); the `-background` fills await the §1
  manifestation pick. **Both amber rules still unenforced (gate owed).**
- **★ FOUR-THEME ARCHITECTURE — R-D15 (2026-07-19).** ONE token store + ONE baseline library, toggling **4 themes:
  Apollo Legacy · Mono · Console (UI) · Supercharge (SC)**. Components bind theme-agnostic roles; theme override sets
  supply the hex. **Apollo Legacy** alone carries the teals AND the HSBC brand `color/grey/100–800`. **The baseline we
  build now = Apollo Mono, "very mono": monochrome throughout, colour ONLY in RAG + data-vis.** Broader colour/theming
  build PARKED ("deal with colours later"). Ledger R-D15; memory `four-theme-architecture`.
  ★ **REINFORCED #108-D3 (Dave, verbatim, `ds-035`):** *"we have 4 themes, mono, legacy, console, and supercharge. they have a lot of overlap but they also diverge, especially the colour palette of legacy and the others, and the grey ramp for supercharge and the others. I just want the flexibility to have these themes and create more."* Plus, explicitly NOT NOW: *"I will also be revisiting the grey ramp for mono, i think we've calculated wrong."* → governs every cross-theme token-collision sweep: divergence between themes on the SAME token name is expected, not a defect by default (see the `--pri-hover` finding, `outputs/_FINDING-canon-pri-hover-brand-mono-fork-2026-08-06-v1.md`).
- **★ Apollo Mono grey ramp = `color/mono/1…15`** (2026-07-19, R-D15). Dual-end brightness curve (γ=1.7, 15 stable
  index steps, black→white), packing resolution to both ends, thinning mid-greys; `#1A1A1A` = `mono/4`. Keys are index
  (theme-remappable); per-step brightness in the token `$description`. In `colour.json` + canon; build green. Tuner:
  `reviews/APOLLO-MONO-GREY-CURVE-2026-07-19-v2.html`. **Grey-tint standing check** (memory `feedback-grey-tint-check`):
  surface greys (`#333`=`grey/800`, `#767676`=`grey/600`) before changing — Dave usually rules black, but confirm.
- **★ Amount-display — P1 atom BUILT + gated (2026-07-19).** Money-format primitive: currency-before-no-space
  (copy-025), tabular figures, U+2212 sign, redacted privacy state. Snippet + `amount-display.meta.json` + review;
  monochrome (directional colour deferred to the colour workstream). Added figure rungs **`.t-cm-figure-4/5/6`**
  (32/16/14, all tabular) to `canon/type.css`; atom is fully composite-bound (no raw font). COMMITTED (conductor).
- **★ Digital black `#1A1A1A` = the new `#000`** (Dave 2026-07-19) — GENERAL, not just the reverse-text halation
  case. Swept all 38 components' dark grounds + `background/default` dark → `#1A1A1A` (shadows/overlays stay pure
  `#000`). COMMITTED. Expands [[neutral-blacks]]'s conditional framing; `#1A1A1A` = `mono/4`.
- **★ R-D16 — Mono semantic greys seated on `color/mono/*` — RULED, enactment PENDING.** Dave ruled on
  `reviews/APOLLO-MONO-SEMANTIC-GREYS-2026-07-19-v1`: text ink → `mono/4 #1A1A1A` (**★ SUPERSEDES `col25-011`**
  for Mono — Grey-8 stays Legacy) · **DROP** secondary text grey (hierarchy = weight/size, "very mono") ·
  `#767676`→`mono/8 #808080` · tinted `#D7D8D6`→`mono/12 #E1E1E1` · mechanical maps approved. **Enactment
  (Sonnet, queued):** write token values + sync the 38 component declarations + regen `canon.css` + re-gate;
  annotate `col25-011`/`colour-usage.md` with the Mono override. Ledger `_proforma/_RAG-DECISIONS.md` R-D16.

- **Project name = Apollo** (renamed from *Promenaut* repo-wide 2026-07-14; "Apollo" singular
  preferred, "Apollo SDS" acceptable). History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-14-rename-and-restructure.md`.
- **Red rule = red is the PRIMARY-action accent, used ONCE per screen** (RULED Dave 2026-07-14) —
  **NOT destructive-only.** Destructive/error takes a distinct, non-red treatment. Supersedes the
  charter §4 register-tied ceiling → now universal. `BRAND-1` gate rewritten accordingly.
  **Propagation gap (OPEN):** historical fitness-test builds + proof-001 `_GATE2-REPORT.md` still
  state the old rule — regenerate if revived. Memory `apollo-rename-and-red-rule-2026-07-14`.
- **Designer pack = shipped-ready** (2026-07-14). `designer-skills-v1/` (4 skills + built KB,
  gitignored); handover artifact **`Apollo-designer-skills.zip`**. Delivery via VS Code + Copilot
  Agent Skills; no Python for v1. Intro ~the 20th; hands-on the 24th. **Untested:** live-fire on a
  designer's machine — top release risk.
- **Working model = land to the live repo as-you-go** (RULED 2026-07-14). Deliverables write straight
  to the connected repo; the `/tmp/ux` snapshot is stale — don't trust it. GitHub Desktop CLOSED
  during Claude commits. Memory `working-model-cloud-vs-device`.
- **Repo restructured for human-readability** (2026-07-14) — root = operating essentials; visual map
  `docs/repo-map.html`. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-14-rename-and-restructure.md`.

- **Component library = Apollo pro-forma programme, in flight.** ONE component skeleton, N modes —
  **Apollo mono** (monochrome base; *"pro-forma" = Apollo mono*) · **Apollo UI** (branded HSBC) ·
  **Apollo SC** (prior branded — "keep the ideas, don't copy the solutions"). **FOUNDATIONAL RULING
  (Dave 2026-07-15):** no hardcoded styling — everything tokenised, sibling libraries governed by
  MODES; enforced by DEF-003 (no JS motion) + DEF-004 (no raw px) in `_build_all.py`.
  **Tranches T1–T8 built + gated** in `knowledge/_proforma/` (interactive one-file-per-tranche);
  rules live in `_PROFORMA-RULES.md` (16 rules, incl. rule 16: every component ships Swiss dossier +
  KB model doc). Reviewable build list =
  `reviews/ITINERARY-2026-07-14-apollo-component-library.{html,xlsx}` (124 items; ~50 real base gaps;
  extend-not-restart). Memory [[proforma-programme]].
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-15-proforma-tranche-arc.md`.
- **TYPE-TOKEN SYSTEM = PROMOTED TO CANON + grid enforced library-wide** (2026-07-17, Dave "crack
  on"): (1) primitives → `tokens/typography.json` + composites → `tokens/typography-composites.json`,
  `type.css` settled; (2) HSBC-general incumbent type+spacing parked as sibling sets — Apollo = the
  proposed HSBC standard, governed by modes; (3) **DEF-005** grid gate wired; (4) retrofit — 230
  off-grid snaps across canon.css + 38 snippets + 9 tranches; (5) vertical-stack rule drafted;
  (6) arrow asset RETIRED; (7) DEF-005 expanded to 50 files, all PASS. Rulings + WHY in
  `knowledge/_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`.
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-17-type-token-build.md`.
- **ATOMISE — build at the true atomic level, compose up** (RULED Dave 2026-07-14). Rolled-up
  patterns are a **debt**, not the model; build atoms → molecules → organisms per the `meta.schema`
  ladder. Known debt: decompose existing rolled-up molecules later. Applies to all new work.

- **Apollo product spine = "lovable on rails" · four phases** (Dave 2026-07-17; labels provisional,
  shape is the vision). **1 · Discover** (ingest/research; chat-to-KB bot likely here) ·
  **2 · Create** (being built now; four modes: **Strict** "Factory" · **Creative** · **Component
  Dev** · **Explore**) · **3 · Craft** (the review doc + comment overlay IS this phase) ·
  **4 · Dispatch** (hand to engineering; may fold away). **The four Create modes = TIERED LEVELS OF
  ADHERENCE** to the rails, guardrails progressively removed, per-tier sub-settings. **a11y (WCAG
  2.2 AA) IS the single non-removable floor** across every mode (per FOUNDATIONAL
  `accessibility-aspiration`) — "non-removable" = LOCKED, not HARDCODED: an **admin access layer**
  tunes every setting incl. the floor. **Apollo = the MOONSHOT** (name rationale). Memory
  `apollo-product-framing`. Unaudited — a framing, not a spec.
- **Product = a *flexing* engine** — one governed core, dials per work-type; floor/churn vs
  ceiling/novel. `ADR-0006`.
- **Output modes = a first-class dial** (Dave 2026-07-05): two fidelity tiers — portable dumb-HTML
  prototypes + build-ready from a prebuilt library, with **Sutherland** *a* target, not *the*
  architecture. Two-way tie: dark-mode work feeds INTO Sutherland; the Figma library IS Sutherland's
  working file. Memories `output-modes-portability`, `sutherland-figma-mapping`. Unaudited.
- **Register = an inference ramp** (NOT a look): sober = retrieve · balanced = extend · expressive =
  invent. Charter `_FIXED-FLEX-CHARTER.md` **§9**.
- **§9a — provenance of "reads HSBC"**: brand-ness resolves to named sources; flag-where-silent is
  advisory; residual gestalt = human. Record: `knowledge/_PROVENANCE-inference-levels_2026-07-04.md`.
- **Two harness modes** (§9a): converge/ship = mode B ADOPTED · explore/noodle = mode A OPEN. Memory

- **Project memory = temporal decision-graph pattern; this file is the cold-start spine.** `ADR-0007`.
- **Supersession discipline · git split · data hygiene** — canonical in `AGENTS.md` (tombstone +
  propagation log in the same pass; Claude commits in terminal, Dave pushes via GitHub Desktop only).
- **Build** — `python3 knowledge/_build_all.py` is the one command; the gate list lives in the script
  and in `GOOD-MORNING.md` §A. (This entry previously carried a third, drifted copy of the list.)
- **State machine records FUTURE/TARGET states too** (RULED 2026-07-05, extends ADR-0007): targets
  carry what · why · blockers · source; the staleness gate must flag a target whose blockers cleared.

  ideas, resurrection candidates); in-flight TARGETS stay below. Unaudited node.

## OPEN — propagation gaps + parked threads

### ⬛ NEW #130 — THE ENACTMENT LANE: `s130-D4` / `D5` / `D6` + TABS + LEGACY REVERSED TEXT (born #130, RULED, **NOT ENACTED**)

**State:** RULED by Dave #130, recorded in `knowledge/_rulings.json` and `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md` § ★★ #130
with the honest status *RULED #130 / NOT ENACTED*. **No value moved in any token file.** **Owner: Dave** — the
enactment licence is his word.
**Method (pointer, not body):** values half → `knowledge/tokens/*.json`; consumption half → the snippet corpus via
`gen_canon_components.py` + regen + gate replay. The full measured grid lives in
`reviews/CONTRAST-CONTROLLER-2026-08-08-v3.html`.
⚠ **Owed at enactment, not now:** legacy success `#00847F` + white sits **at** the 4.5 boundary and must be
**measured**, not assumed; legacy info moves toward `#4F77B0` per the `s122-D3` map.
⛔ **Dark mode:** Dave ratified *"(a) ~8%, (b) all three"*, but **two of the three already invert via the cascade**
and **the banner wash MUST NOT** (RAG fills are mode-invariant by his own `s122-D1/D2/D3`). **No machinery was
added and the discrepancy was declared back to him** — an enactor must not quietly add the third.

✅ **AMENDED BY ADDITION #131 — the LEGACY-REVERSED-TEXT half of this item is DONE.** `s131-D1` (Dave, #131)
ruled and enacted the legacy RAG fills from his own Figma values — error `#A8000B` · warning `#FFBB33` ·
success `#00847F` · information `#305A85`, white text **and** marks on error/success/information, amber the
sole dark-ink exception — which **supersedes the `#4F77B0` direction named above** and closes the
*"exact values owed at enactment"* clause. ⛔ **The REST of this item is UNTOUCHED: `s130-D4` / `D5` / `D6`
and tabs are still RULED-NOT-ENACTED.** Do not read the half as the whole. Evidence: `knowledge/_rulings.json`
§ `s131-D1` · `reviews/LEGACY-RAG-BANNERS-2026-08-08-s131-v1.html` · `gen_theme_cascade --check` rc=0 201/206.
[born #131 · guards: the `#4F77B0` and *"values owed"* text above · until: `s130-D4`/`D5`/`D6` are enacted]

### ⛔ NEW #131 — THE COMPONENT-SPEC KG IS IN NO INDEX AND NO CHECKLIST (born #131, REPORTED NOT REPAIRED, REMEDY IS DAVE'S)

**What was measured:** `knowledge/components/*.meta.json` — **76** (⚠ **MEASURED at the wrap and it corrected this session's own figure: the brief and every first draft said 78 — 78 is the DIRECTORY's entry count; 76 are metas, plus `meta.schema.json` and `_ACCESSIBILITY-CONFORMANCE.md`; 77 repo-wide, one lives at `knowledge/_proforma/icon-button.meta.json`. Registered as `ASSERT-009` so the count is re-tested, not repeated**) of component specification carrying
**token claims in prose** — is **NOT in the memento index**, and **no enactment checklist names it**.
`banner.meta.json` sat **stale against `s131-D1`** through the entire values-and-consumption enactment and was
surfaced **by Dave's own question**, not by any gate. It was then amended by addition (three claims) and
re-validated — the *file* is current; the *class* is not fixed.
**Class:** identical to #130's *"true when written, gone false, nothing re-checks it"* — the **fifth medium**.
⬛ **OWNER: DAVE — three options, none taken here:**
- **(a)** add the metas to the memento index (retrieval surfaces them; nothing checks them);
- **(b)** a **parse-gate** on meta token-claims — parse in the consumer's grammar, the strongest option;
- **(c)** an enactment-checklist line — cheapest, weakest; a convention with no gate is a preference.
⚠ **Dave's attached question, recorded so it is not lost: how IS the design KG used, indexed and checked?**
Honest answer as of #131: **used by hand · indexed nowhere · checked by nothing.** Narrative:
`_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-08-08-131-the-legacy-rag-fills-and-the-design-kg-nothing-checks.md` § Finding 3.

### ⬛ NEW #131 — CONSOLE/SC LIGHTER INFORMATION BLUE: DIRECTION ONLY, NO VALUE (born #131)

✅ **CLOSED #132 — `s132-D1` (Dave, off the controller): fill `#5A85C1`, mark INK, RULED AND ENACTED END-TO-END; see `knowledge/_rulings.json` § `s132-D1` and the ⏱ LATEST delta.** The block below stands as history of the open state. [born #131 · closed #132 · guards: `_rulings.json` § `s132-D1` · until: rolls per 2d term]

`s131-D1` explicitly does **not** carry a console/SC information value — its own `watch` field says so:
*"console/SC lighter info blue is DIRECTION ONLY, no value picked — do not enact it under this ruling."*
**A controller is owed** (Dave rules from live controllers fast and in his own words). ⛔ **Nothing may be
enacted for console/SC under `s131-D1`.** Note also that this does **not** close the console/SC
**information-REST** contrast worklist items — those stay in the 4-REAL register below.
[born #131 · guards: `_rulings.json` § `s131-D1`.watch · until: Dave rules a console/SC value from a controller]

### ⚠ NEW #131 — A CONTROL THAT COULD NOT RUN: THE 156 VALIDATOR FAILS ARE ATTRIBUTED BY CONTENT (born #131)

`_validate_snippets.py` reports **156 ❌**. The intended `git stash` control **returned rc=1** — the known
zero-byte `.git/index.lock` on the mount — so **the with/without-diff control DID NOT RUN**. Attribution fell
back to **content**: no fail line names the minted slot `rag/text/on-information`; the **12 Banner fails are the
pre-existing #130 drift family** (mono base vs legacy-reference hexes) and this diff touches none of their
value-pairs. ⛔ **This is an honest UNPROVEN, priced as a TODO — not a pass.** The 156 are **reported, not
repaired** (repair is outside this session's licence).
[born #131 · guards: any later claim that #131 left the validator unchanged · until: a control runs, or Dave rules the 156]

### ⬛ DAVE'S — THE ERROR-MARK IMAGE CONFIRM (born #130, NOT RULED)

Dave sent an image that **did not arrive**. The conductor's provisional reading — *white shape, red glyph*, both
legs **6.02** — is recorded as **provisional** and is **not a ruling**. The mono `--mark-error` companion options
were measured: `#FFFFFF` **6.02** · `#F0F0F0` **5.28**. **Owner: Dave**; nothing may be enacted from the
provisional reading.

### ⬛ DAVE'S — MARK-vs-FILL 3.0 GATE: BUILD IT, OR PUT IT ON THE WORKLIST (born #130)

Asked at #130 and **not answered**. **Owner: Dave.**

### ⬛ NEW #130 — TWO RATIFIED WORKLIST ITEMS (born #130)

Ratified by Dave as **named worklist items**, not as rulings: **(a)** console + SC **information REST** contrast
failures, **3.81 / 4.13** · **(b)** legacy **success washed**. Both fold into the enactment lane above; neither is
enacted.

### ⬛ NEW #130 — `_validate_state_contrast.py --selftest` IS ENVIRONMENT-DEPENDENT AND SILENT ABOUT IT (born #130)

**Measured:** rc=**2** at **18** arms without `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/var/tmp/pw-browsers-129`; rc=**0** at
**25** arms with it. It does **not** say which world it ran in. ★ **A selftest whose arm count depends on the
environment and does not declare it publishes a green that means two different things.** **Remedy proposed, NOT
built: a named refusal** [[honest-refusal-needs-a-legal-form]]. **Owner: Dave** (a refusal is a gate behaviour).

### ⛔⛔ NEW #130 — AN ANCHOR AIMED AT A ROLLING STACK IS GUARANTEED TO ROT (born #130, NOT RULED)

`s130-D2` repointed `s129-D1`'s rotten anchor at `GOOD-MORNING.md#### 2026-08-08 #129`, and **this ritual's own
step-2f roll then moved that stratum into `notes/_GAUGE-LOG.md`** — breaking the pointer for the **second
consecutive wrap**. ★ **The ritual itself is the thing that moves the target.** Repointed at the **append-only**
gauge log (a durable target); `_governs --selftest` rc=0 restored; **declared a MOVE, not a rot.**
⛔ **The general remedy — never anchor at a roll-eligible region, or have the mover repoint what it moves — is
NOT ruled here. Owner: Dave.**

### ⛔ NEW #130 — THE STATE-CONTRAST AUDIT'S BANNER 4.09 MEASURED THE WRONG BUTTON (born #130, NOT REPAIRED)

The 4.09 reading is the **chromed ghost** (`.abtn`, `knowledge/canon/canon.css:3959`), **not** the quaternary Dave
says ships. Under the true quaternary the **pressed failure DISAPPEARS (15.27)** and the failure **MIGRATES TO
REST** — **8 of 48 readings**, because `--button-quaternary-label-default` resolves to `--text-default`, page ink
on a RAG fill. ⛔ **The audit file and the snippet corpus were NOT touched: the snippet button-style question is
DAVE'S.** Related, recorded not acted on: canon and snippets **already disagree on error red**
(`#B92F1E`/`#CC4333` inline vs store `#F6604C`, which lives in `semantic-colour.json` and in no live component);
canon declares **no banner-scoped quaternary** and quaternary has **no pressed token** (hover == pressed), so the
press is **inexpressible** until `s130-D4` is enacted.

### ⬛ THE CARRIED SET — the residual list that has rolled every session, HOMED #125 by the EXIT CHECK
⚠ **This list has lived ONLY on the rolling banner/delta residual line for twelve sessions.** A banner is
a Polaroid: the moment its delta rolls, the item is unreachable from live state. The EXIT CHECK exists to
catch exactly this and it has been catching pieces of this list one at a time; **homing the whole set is
cheaper than homing it again next wrap.** ⛔ **Nothing here is ruled, re-scoped or closed by this wrap —
this is a POINTER block, and every method body stays at its pointer.**
- **`s116-D4` / `s116-D5`** — ruled #116, unenacted. → `knowledge/_rulings.json` · ledger § ★ #116.
- **`s114-D2`** — the adoption-time CITATION GATE, four binding conditions. → `GOOD-MORNING.md` §C·4,
  `#114`'s ruled-and-unbuilt set, item ③ (the one item of that set still open).
- **The STALE-MOUNT SEAM** — a mount can corroborate a stale premise; verify at boot against a source
  with a DIFFERENT CLOCK (`git log` vs mtime). Remedy unruled. → `_RUNBOOK-context-gauge.md`.
- **P4 — the `_CHAIN.md` trim.** Phase 4 of the #110 roll, priced at 14% of the boot floor, **not** the
  main event. ⚠ **P-SET COLLISION: two different P-sets share the numbers P4/P6/P7 and their statuses are
  OPPOSITE** — always name which set. → `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`:4049 ff.
- **`89-D2` — RULED, NOT ENACTED.** It lives **only** in `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`; the ruling store's
  count does not include it, so *"how many open rulings"* answered from the store is short by this one.
- **`ds-032`** · **`ds-025`** (boot-floor attribution; re-scoped #109) → `knowledge/_DS-IMPROVEMENTS.md`.
- **The BOOT-RENT PLAN (P2)** and **the ATTRIBUTION RE-PROBE** — ⛔ **DAVE'S, twelfth roll at #125.**
- **The FALL-THROUGH CLASS has no gate** (born #123) — see its own block below.
[born ≤#114 · homed #125 · guards: this block · until: each is enacted or ruled]

### ⬛ DAVE'S — P1 · G4 · the RECORDER CONSTANTS: three opens that had NO standing home (HOMED #125 by the EXIT CHECK)
⚠ **Copied up here at #125's wrap, and the reason is this session's own finding.** These three have
been carried as *"Dave's opens UNCHANGED"* on every banner since #113–#120, and #124's banner asserted
their standing home was *"`_LIVE-STATE.md` § OPEN"*. **That claim was never true** — only the chart-meta
enum edits were ever homed there. A pointer to a home that does not exist is the same class the whole of
#125 was spent on: a claim that reads as authoritative and that nothing re-checks. Homed, not ruled.
- **P1 — the boot-attribution split, AWAITING DAVE'S CONFIRM TO OPEN.** Phase 1 of the four-phase #110
  roll (`notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`:4049): split the **56,308 unattributed** of the first-turn boot by
  tokenising what is actually on disk (skill frontmatter, `CLAUDE.md`, plugin manifests), the Cowork
  system prompt falling out as the residual by subtraction. P2 boot-rent · P3 boot-ceiling gate ·
  P4 `_CHAIN.md`'s 10,499 are the rest of that roll. ⛔ **Priced, seen by Dave, NOT opened — his word.**
- **G4 — GM §C over its warn cap.** `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md`:3040: *"GM §C 191 > 150 warn cap →
  closes when Dave picks OFFLOAD / TRIM / KEEP."* ⛔ **The pick is Dave's; the cap is not to be moved.**
- **The conductor-surface RECORDER CONSTANTS — 3 MEASURABLY STALE, refresh is DAVE'S.**
  `knowledge/_surface_recorder.py` (RULED #112-D1, built #113) grades against real-token constants that
  the measurements have since drifted away from; the gate DECLARES the drift rather than hiding it
  (`_capture_gate.py` boot-drift line), which is the whole bar. ⛔ **Only Dave's ruling closes it.**
[born ≤#113 · homed #125 · guards: this block · until: Dave rules each]

### ⬛ DAVE'S — the 4 REAL state-contrast failures surfaced by `s125-D3` (born #125)
`s125-D3` taught `parse()` to read `color(srgb …)` and to REFUSE unreadable syntax by name; **20 false
failures vanished and 4 REAL ones appeared.** ⛔ **These are DAVE'S to rule — this wrap did not fix,
close or waive any of them, and no threshold was touched.**
- **Banner `.abtn:active` — 4.09:1, needs 4.5. LIGHT *and* DARK.** `knowledge/canon/canon.css:3963` /
  `:3975`. NEW, surfaced only because the parse refusal stopped fabricating a pass.
- **Pre-existing, also REAL:** Tabs ×2 DARK at **1.00:1** — `.cn-tabs .ovcount`, `canon.css:2496`, a
  genuine token collision (white on white in dark) · Selection-controls ×8 (light/pressed **3.95:1** ×6,
  dark **3.66:1**).
[born #125 · guards: this block · until: Dave rules the four]

### ✅ ENACTED #126 — `s125-D1`: the chain banner's build-step count is a GENERATED figure (born #125, enacted #126)
**Dave ruled** at #125 that the build-step count in the chain banner stops being a typed number and becomes a
**GENERATED figure** — `knowledge/_gen_chain.py` reads `len(STEPS)` out of `knowledge/_build_all.py`'s
AST at generation time. He chose this **over a third re-stamp**, explicitly. ✅ **ENACTED #126.**
`_gen_chain.py` carries `BUILD_VERDICT_MARK` · `VERDICT_SHA = "18c7789"` · `BuildStepCountError` ·
`_steps_in()` (AST) · `build_steps_now()` · `build_steps_at()` · `build_verdict_line()`; the **splice** is a
20-line purely-additive block in `_capture_gate.chain_parts()` — **the one slicer**, because `read_chain_tk`
measures exactly what it returns and `_gen_chain` writes exactly what it returns, so a downstream injection
would be **written but not measured** (#41's second-consumer drift). ⚠ **That placement differs from the
ruling's literal wording (`_gen_chain`) and is declared as an IMPLEMENTATION RECONCILIATION, not a
re-ruling — flagged for Dave's eye** [[instruction-right-cause-wrong]]. **BOTH ends are measured and the
shortfall is computed**, because publishing only the live count would have manufactured *"ALL 98 STEPS
ASKED AND GREEN"*, a sentence nobody measured. ★ **The premise proved itself inside one day: 97 at #125's
probe, 98 at #126's enactment** — `s125-D2` added a step in between. **12 mutation bites 0 fail · 5
permanent bites wired into `_gen_chain.selftest()`, the load-bearing one re-deriving `len(STEPS)` from disk.**
⬛ **The 23-step shortfall it exposed is a SEPARATE open item — see the block below.**
Ledger: `knowledge/_rulings.json` (`s125-D1`, status + `enacted`) · `notes/_MEMENTO-DECISIONS.md` § ★ #125 / § ★ #126.

### ⬛ NEW #126 — 23 BUILD STEPS HAVE NEVER BEEN INSIDE ANY GREEN VERDICT
Surfaced by `s125-D1`'s enactment and **statable only because both ends are now measured**: the `#62` green
verdict covers the **75** steps that existed at `18c7789`; disk holds **98**. ⇒ **23 steps have never been
asked inside a green single-process build.** ⚠ **This is a FINDING, not a failure** — it says nothing about
whether those 23 steps pass; it says the published verdict has never covered them. A full single-process
`_build_all.py` run is sandbox-impossible (~49s vs the ~45s call kill), so **closing this belongs to CI**.
⛔ **Nothing here is ruled, waived or scheduled by this wrap.**

### ⬛ NEW #126 — `_governs.py` SELFTEST IS RED: `s121-D1` POINTER ROT (`canon.css:5548` absent)
`knowledge/_capture_gate.py --selftest` fails inside `_governs.py`: the ruling **`s121-D1` points at
`knowledge/canon/canon.css:5548`, and that line does not exist.** ⚠ **PRE-EXISTING, and the attribution was
CHECKED rather than assumed** — `_governs.py` and `canon.css` are untouched in `git status`, and #126's
`_capture_gate.py` diff is 20 lines with **0 deletions**, gated behind a marker-presence test
[[attribute-the-diff]]. ★ It is the same class the whole of #125 was spent on, in a fourth medium: **a
POINTER that was true when written and nothing re-checks it** [[no-gate-parses-the-artefact]].

The block above states that `s121-D1` points at `knowledge/canon/canon.css:5548` and that *"that line does
not exist"*. **MEASURED #127 — both halves wrong.** (a) `_rulings.json` points at **bare `canon.css`**; the
record above **silently added the `knowledge/canon/` prefix**, and that is what hid the real defect — a path
**never resolvable from repo root**, so the entry was **BORN RED at #121**, not rotted into red. (b) Line
**5548 DOES exist** — today it reads `--alpha-84: 0.84;`. ⚠ **A repair driven off that sentence would have
gone GREEN pointing at an unrelated token.** The construct the ruling actually cites (the RAG roundel policy)

55-step build"*; disk today is **30 validators, 98 steps**. It also draws a **different subject** — the
dream-pass lane — not the six subsystems #125 was asked for. **Dave's disposition: v2 GENERATED (so it
cannot drift), v1 KEPT and TOMBSTONED.** ⛔ **Neither has happened; both roll to #127 — the SECOND roll.**
⚠ The v1 file is still live and still asserts the stale figures — that is instance 1 of the through-line in a

Found while proving `s125-D3`, scoped OUT of it on purpose so the ruling's mutation test proved one
clause and not a bundle [[mutation-tests-the-clause-not-the-feature]].

  selected pill, so it measures the wrong background ⇒ **32 FALSE failures**: Segmented-control ×12 ·
  Charts ×16 · View-options ×4. **Real rendering is fine.** Distinct from `s125-D3`, which was a *parse*
  defect; this is a *geometry* defect.
- **`out[3] = <headline>` OVERWRITES instead of inserting** — it eats the first snippet's heading. The
  committed `knowledge/_STATE-CONTRAST-AUDIT.md` claims *"across 38 snippet(s)"* and contains **37**;
  `Accordion` was eaten. ⚠ **AND, measured at this wrap: with ZERO snippets in scope the same line raises
  `IndexError: list assignment index out of range`** — the defect is not only an overwrite, it is a crash.
  ⚠ **Also observed at this wrap: `_validate_state_contrast.py` has NO `--selftest` flag and silently
  treats an unknown argument as a snippet-name FILTER** — an unknown that is defaulted rather than named
  [[measuring-tool-must-not-guess]]. **Not fixed, not ruled — recorded.**
- ⚠ **The artefact is STALE by 37:** `_STATE-CONTRAST-AUDIT.md` covers 38 snippets; `knowledge/snippets/`
  holds **75** `*.reference.html` (measured at this wrap). It has not been regenerated.

✅ **FIXED #127 — BOTH, WITH THE BOUNDARY PROVEN AND NOTHING WAIVED.**
- **`effBg` — the class was not "ancestors only", it was the MODEL.** It modelled the paint stack as the
  ancestor chain **when painting is a z-ordered geometry of boxes**; ancestors are a subset, so it was
  **blind by construction** to an absolutely-positioned sibling. It now composites the browser's own hit
  stack (`elementsFromPoint`, paint order, src-over).
- **`out[3]` — a derived summary written into a positional slot the loop above owns.** Now an INSERT. The
  eaten `Accordion` heading is back, and the zero-snippet `IndexError` is a **named refusal**. Added
  `verify_report()` (`StateContrastReportError`), `--selftest` (**19 arms**), `--help`, and named refusals
  for an unknown argument and for a filter that matches nothing [[measuring-tool-must-not-guess]].
- ★ **THE BOUNDARY, PROVEN — TEXT failures 46 → 14: exactly the 32 NAMED false failures removed**
  (Segmented-control ×12 · Charts ×16 · View-options ×4), **ZERO added**. **All 4 REAL failures survive with
  IDENTICAL ratios** — Banner `.abtn:active` **4.09:1** ×4 · Selection-controls **3.95:1** ×6 + **3.66:1** ×2 ·
  Tabs dark **1.00:1** ×2 — **still red, nothing waived, nothing re-thresholded.** **Independently confirmed
  by a second instrument sharing no code**: screenshot pixels read **21.0:1** where the gate had said 1:1.

  real count are asserted equal by the script on every write**. Coverage **38 → 75**, which makes the

- **Sub 1:** the `_validate_state_contrast.py` exemption reason (*"`UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`
  on all 3 CDNs"*) **was never true** — it observed the **download SUCCEED**, with the installer then
  throwing `EPERM … rmdir '__dirlock'`. **A failure message AFTER a success** — a shape
  `_RUNBOOK-render-verify.md` explicitly banks.
- **Sub 2:** playwright's node downloader **IS** TLS-blocked on all 3 CDNs, and `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
  does **not** fix it, while `curl` reaches the same URLs fine. It installed chromium **by hand** to
  `/tmp/pw-browsers` (needs `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/tmp/pw-browsers`,
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/extralibs/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu`).
- **Third datapoint, this wrap, and it adjudicates NOTHING:** sub 2's hand-installed browser was still
  present at `/tmp/pw-browsers` and a real chromium launched from it, while playwright's own default path
  `~/.cache/ms-playwright/` did not exist. **This says the workaround persists; it says nothing about
  whether the downloader is blocked**, because no download was attempted at this wrap.

### ⚠⚠ NEW #129 — DAVE'S: BOTH #128 COMMITS CERTIFY THE WRONG SESSION (found, NOT diagnosed, NOT repaired)
**The fact, checkable in one command.** `git log --format='%h %s'` shows `d74552e` and `ed4ce3a` (both

**own message body asserts** *"this message's first line deliberately begins with '#128'"*. **That claim
is false as committed.**
**Two candidate causes, NEITHER eliminated, and the difference matters:**
- **(a) the msgfile's first line was genuinely wrong**, in which case the `#124` subject assert did
  exactly its job and **faithfully certified a wrong line** — the gate is sound and the input was not; or
- **(b) the assert did not bite**, in which case the gate built at #124 is not running on this path and
  every subject since is uncertified.
⛔ **NOT diagnosed further and NOT repaired at #129 — this is DAVE'S**, and it is #130's opening item.
★ **The class is this session's own ruling in the git log:** the body's claim about its own first line was
a **conclusion inscribed at write time with nothing re-checking it at commit time** (`s129-D5`); a subject
line is the **sixth medium** on that list. ⚠ **A live regression check ran at #129's own wrap** — this
session's msgfile first line begins `#129 2026-08-08 — ` and the post-commit subject was verified equal to

> defect on its own first commit (`29b4c2e`), which is how the mechanism was found:**
> - `knowledge/_git_commit.sh`'s **T3 block (#77-D2) REPLACES the msgfile's first line** with a headline
>   **derived from `GOOD-MORNING.md`'s ★ LATEST banner** — the msgfile's own line 1 is discarded, by design.
> - **#78-D3 prefixes `"after "`** to that headline **on any commit not run with `--wrap`**.
> ⇒ **a non-wrap commit inherits whatever banner happens to be on disk.** #128 wrote no banner at all, so
> both of its commits inherited **#127's**. **Neither candidate cause above is right as stated:** the
> msgfile's first line was never consulted, and the assert did not fail to bite — **it compares the
> REWRITTEN msgfile to the commit subject, so it is TRUE and USELESS for this question.**
> ⛔ **STRUCK: this session's own banner briefly claimed *"post-commit subject verified equal to msgfile
> line 1"*.** That was written before the commit ran and **was false the moment it was written** — the
> exact class `s129-D5` names, committed by the session that ruled it [[assertion-propagation-gap]].

  *"every carried item is written with its AGE in sessions"* into `_RUNBOOK-capture-ritual.md` § 2c

  residual is the first to use it**. ⬛ **The other half stands:** the ordinal that counts the rolls
  (*"FIFTEENTH roll"*) is still **hand-typed prose that nothing reads or checks** — `_roll_state.py`
  generates the 2c/2d/2f residual line but not the carry ordinal. **A count nobody can re-derive is a
  conclusion, not a measurement** [[measure-dont-convert-units]].
- **P3 — LARGELY CLOSED, and the closure was verified not assumed.** The predicted sweep mechanism is
  **gone**: `knowledge/_git_commit.sh` no longer contains `git add -A` (retired by d0802-P5, enacted #128);
  the only staging call is now `git add -- "$_p"` at `:257`, over paths named explicitly by the caller.

### ⬛ DAVE'S — the 3 chart-meta PROVENANCE-ENUM edits (born #120, HOMED #123 by the EXIT CHECK)
⚠ **Copied up here at #123's wrap because it had NO standing home** — it lived only on the #120
delta and the rolling banners, and #120's delta rolls at this wrap (ritual 2c/2d EXIT CHECK).
#120's build repair set `"provenance": "worker-composition" → "code"` in three chart `meta.json`
files (`Chart-histogram`, `Chart-butterfly-v`, `Chart-butterfly-h`), keeping the worker context in
each `$note`. The integrity gate is PASS on it. **It is a judgment call, flagged for Dave's eye and
never ratified** — three sessions running it has been carried as "unchanged" without a home.

### ✅ CLOSED #123 — the SIX parked consequences of the #122 mark-map pass (born #122, closed #123)
**ALL SIX ARE CLOSED**, by four rulings taken with the rendered artefact in front of Dave:
`s123-D1`…`s123-D4` (`knowledge/_rulings.json` entries 58–61) plus the **v6 controller sign-off**
(*"mega"* — `knowledge/_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md`, which closes consequence 6 and was the licence for the
rest). Arc: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-08-07-123-rag-world-signoff-and-tint-opacities.md`.

overrides · 2 → `s123-D2` `ownsHexes` **REFRESHED**, provenance re-run **37 UNCHANGED** (so none of
the 37 was an artefact of the stale map) · 3 → `s123-D4` SC badge shift **RATIFIED** (*"SC badge is
fine"*) · 4 → the **4.56** white-on-teal legacy success leg **ACCEPTED with the v6 pass** · 5 →
`s123-D3` tint scope **RULED + ENACTED IN FULL** (legacy+SC solid · mono+console tuned opacities;
**AMENDS ds-026** — alpha is no longer state-changes-only, Dave ratified *"this is fine"*) · 6 →

### ✅ CLOSED #124 — the memento-package DELTA-AUDIT RE-BASELINE (born #120, blocked on #64/#114, closed #124)
**The word was TAKEN and then SUPERSEDED SAME SESSION BY ITS OWN ENACTMENT.** Dave first ruled **WAIT** —
the package red stands until the #115 tally is judged, *then* sync. The tally was distilled
(`reviews/outputs/graph-mark-tally-digest-v1.html`) and **judged the same session** (*"i've gone with all
your recommendations"*), so the close condition fell inside the window and the sync ran: memento-package
copies of `_memento_search.py` re-synced · **`_graph_edges.py` ADDED to `VERBATIM_SET` + both copies + both
manifests**. ⚠ **The sync ALONE left a DEAD IMPORT — delta-audit GREEN, artefact BROKEN.** That is the
`no-gate-parses-the-artefact` class (#122) recurring in a different medium, and it was **caught by an
import-closure probe, not by the audit**. **Final: delta-audit 0 failures · validator selftest green ·
package import PROVEN.** ⛔ **This closes the RE-BASELINE only — the separate `v1` designer-skills pack

### ✅ CLOSED #124 — the #115 GRAPH PROGRAMME, in full (`s124-D1`)
**`_rulings.json` entry 62. DEMOTE IS RETIRED: the graph-mark stays MARK-ONLY, permanently** — a display
label, never a ranking lever. Ratified by Dave on Claude's recommendation with **measured** evidence: the
s124 tally found **76 of 79 marks were noise**, so the mark cannot discriminate mention-as-history from
mention-as-authority, and a demote built on it would mostly bury healthy records. ★ The arc is the point:
**instrumented (#115) → tallied (#115/#124) → judged by Dave (#124) → ruled (#124)** — the observation
window existed so this ruling would have provenance instead of recollection. Closes candidates-brief
**item 4**, the last open item of the programme. ⚠ **Probe pollution was DECLARED on the digest's own card
face:** ~half the raw marks were #124's own queries; every judged card had clean sightings.

### ✅ GATED #124 — the 83,000-character COMMIT SUBJECT (born #78 as an unruled finding, gated #124)
Commit **`0eacf2d` is PUSHED and carries an ~83,000-character subject**; its msgfile body was JSONL with
**no blank line after the headline**, and git's `%s` folds everything up to the first blank. **Dave RULED:
gate and harden, KEEP THE HISTORY — no rewrite, no force-push.** ⇒ **`0eacf2d`'s subject STAYS in the log,
by ruling**; truncate git-log reads rather than trying to repair them. Enacted: `_git_commit.sh` **T3
inserts the blank separator** · a **post-commit 200-char subject cap fails loud** · `_test_git_commit.py`
carries `subject_fold_blank_line_inserted_124` + `MUTATION_blank_insert_removed_bites_124`, **22 arms
green**. ★ **The finding had been DOCUMENTED since #78 — in the harness's own comment, as *"not a script
defect"* — and never gated. A documented-but-ungated hazard is a scheduled defect.**
⛔ **RESIDUAL, UNPROVEN AND DECLARED NOT CHASED, and it is nobody's to close silently:** **how JSONL got
into that msgfile is unattributed.** It is not a gap in the gate — the gate now bites regardless of cause —
but the cause is unknown and is recorded as unknown [[a-crash-is-not-a-fail]].

### ★★ OPEN, NO GATE — the ACCIDENTAL FALL-THROUGH class (born #123, standing)
**When a base value moves, every theme that MEANT the old value must declare it.** Inheritance is
indistinguishable from agreement until the base changes — at which point a theme that was merely
quiet gets silently re-ruled by someone else's decision. **Three instances, two sessions:** legacy
warn/info backgrounds (#122, ruled back at `s123-D1`) · legacy `rag/error-tint` undeclared (#123) ·
supercharge tints undeclared (#123). The last two were found **while enacting the remedy for the
first**, and both would have silently inherited mono's new values. All three are closed by explicit
declaration; **the CLASS is not.** ⚠ **No gate looks for an undeclared theme value whose base is
about to move** — this is `ds-039`'s cousin: not a gate that failed, a state nothing inspects.
Remedy UNRULED, unpriced. [born #123 · guards: this block · until: a gate ships or Dave rules it closed]

*(historical, kept as the record of what was parked — every item above is now closed)*
The five rulings `s122-D1`…`s122-D5` are CLOSED. These are their **mechanical consequences**,
none of them ruled, none of them decided by the session that produced them. Full arc:
`_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-08-07-mark-map-pass-and-the-half-dead-canon.md`.
1. **Legacy warning/information BACKGROUNDS fell through to the new mono values** — `#E0A61F` /
   `#78A7E8` (were `#F0B13A` / `#7DABCD`). Never declared in `apollo-legacy.overrides.json`, so
   never ruled. **UNRULED — his call whether legacy declares its own.**
2. **`_themes.json` `ownsHexes` is STALE** — *"`#B92F1E` is Mono's only red"* is false as of
   `s122-D3` (console/supercharge error). ⚠ The theme-provenance advisory's **37** are measured
   against that stale map, so the figure is not comparable across the boundary.
3. **Supercharge `badge/` + `tabs/badge/background` shifted to `#B92F1E`** via store alias edges —
   a mechanical consequence of `s122-D3`, **Dave's eye owed.**
4. **Legacy success white-on-teal mark leg = 4.56** — the weakest leg in the new world, over the
   4.5 bar. Recorded, not flagged as a defect.
5. **`*-tint` pairs remain UNRULED for mode-invariance** — the declared scope residual of `s122-D1`.
6. **NOT DRIVEN VISUALLY:** nobody has eyeballed rendered marks on the new fills.
   `reviews/outputs/mark-map-controller-v6.html` is in `knowledge/_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md` awaiting him.
   ⚠ Both of #122's real findings came from Dave's eye, not from the 19+ green gates — this is not
   a formality (see `ds-039`).

### ✅ FIXED #123 — `gen_canon_tokens.py` no longer destroys the hand-authored TOKENS atoms
The canon `TOKENS alpha` / `marks` / `mark-carriers` atoms sit inside AUTO markers with **no store
origin**, so a `gen_canon_tokens.py` run rewrote the AUTO span and took them out (`s121-D1` defect,
born #121, restated #122). **FIXED #123:** the generator now **harvests the hand-authored atoms
before the rewrite and re-injects them after**, and refuses with a named `AtomPreserveError` if one
would be dropped. Evidence: 3-bite selftest (`harvest · preserve · refusal`) re-run at this wrap —
`gen_canon_tokens selftest OK`; **driven twice on the real file, idempotent, atoms 3/3**.
⛔ **What we got wrong, same session:** the first version's own header comment matched its
marker-count regex (`TOKENS <name> START`) and would have raised a **spurious refusal on the NEXT
regen** — a false alarm shaped exactly like the defect it guards. Tightened to the `===== TOKENS`
form before it shipped. *An instrument whose own documentation is inside its own search space will
eventually measure itself.*

### ✅ RULED #108 — `type.css:180` dark-mode specificity collision, ink = `#1A1A1A`, NOT YET ENACTED
`knowledge/canon/type.css:180` ships `[data-theme="dark"]{background:#111;color:#fff}`. Its
attribute-selector specificity (0-1-0) beats any component's plain `body{background:var(--page)}`
(0-0-1), so **every dark-mode pane renders `rgb(17,17,17)` instead of the declared `#1A1A1A`**
even though `--page` resolves correctly. Observed live (real Dark button) on
`showroom/confirmation.html` and `showroom/chart-donut.html`; pre-existing, not introduced at #104.
**RULED #108 (Dave, by eye, `ds-033`): ink = `#1A1A1A`.** `type.css` NOT yet touched — the ruling

### ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-19) — `gen_rules_index.py` truncation fixed
The `chunk[:500]` cap in `rule_text()` was cutting 11+ rules mid-sentence in `_RECONCILIATION.md` and making
their tails unsearchable in `_consult.py` (`icon-015` alone lost ~2300 chars). **Fix: cap removed** — the
walk-back already bounds `rule_text` to one bullet/paragraph, so full text now flows to both consumers.
Verified independently by the rules-index worker (465 rules intact, longest icon-015=2833, old-cap
fingerprint gone). Provenance comment in the generator so a cold session won't "restore" the cap. Receipt:
`notes/_receipts/2026-07-19-worker-rules-index-truncation.md`.

### ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-18) — the binding mechanism's BLAST RADIUS now has a gate
`_validate_type_blast_radius.py` (blocking, wired into `_build_all.py`) + registry
`canon/_type-bindings.json`. Bites on any UNREGISTERED / ESCAPED / UNWAIVED-BARE appended selector;
current debt registered + waived so it lands green. Full ruling + v1 limits: **T-D13** in
`_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`. Residual DEBT to burn down (non-`/1` batch): namespace `h2` (25
files) then the scoped-element set — tracked there, not here.

### 🟠 OPEN — the non-`/1` batch, and why DEF-006 stays unwired
**61 non-`/1` font shorthands remain in `snippets/`**; the bulk of the remaining **690 TYPE-002** sit
in the pro-forma tranches, carrying line-heights 1.1–1.6 — binding REPLACES them with canon and
**things move**. Needs its own reviewed batch with T-D12's before/after pixel discipline.
**DEF-006 is 780 → 729 and stays UNWIRED until this lands** — wiring it earlier trains everyone to
ignore a red build.

### Awaiting Dave — small, no analysis needed
- ~~Matting rung for green + blue~~ — **RULED R-D4 (2026-07-18): both matted 15%** (`#2B7E4F` /
  `#306EC6`), red as-is; role tokens promoted (see LIVE → RAG). Rung came from a direct readback —
  the pin export named the hue, not the row (the overlay row-identity debt biting again).
- ~~**`{#dv-017}`(a) CONTRADICTION**~~ **RESOLVED R-D5 (2026-07-19): split the clause** — directional deltas
  red/green ONLY; RAG status a separate concern (R-D3). Enacted in `data-visualisation.md`.
- ~~**★ RAG light-mode FILLS — REOPENED (R-D11)**~~ **RESOLVED + LOCKED 2026-07-19 (R-D14).** Light green `#5DAC7B` /
  blue `#7DABCD` (H241), dark stays R-D10; per-mode proven. See LIVE → RAG. **Only open piece: the token promotion**
  (`rag/*` per-mode + rebind behind the blast-radius gate) — Sonnet-appropriate, deferred.
- **§1 RAG manifestation — OPEN.** Which forms are canon: Status-indicator dot+label (existing canon) · filled
  cell/badge · bar/edge; tags+pills EXCLUDED by canon (ctkt). Decision sheet built
  (`reviews/RAG-STATUS-MANIFESTATION-2026-07-19-v1`), awaiting Dave's canon pick (A / A+B / A+B+C). Then a
  Sonnet build: rebind Status-indicator to the R-D10 dark set **as amended by R-D11** (R-D10's
  mode-stability claim is dead — a build citing R-D10 alone re-enacts it · s124 tally SAVE), spec
  cell/bar as gated components (cells need more vertical padding).
- ~~**`.tag` COLLISION**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-18.** Was three things under one name: the tag component
  (14px), a smaller reuse (12px), and a masthead descriptor `.h .tag`. Ruled (Dave): tag atom = 3
  variants (dismissible/bordered/plain) × 2 sizes (`.tag`/`.tag--sm`), `.tag--plain` for borderless;
  colour/RAG deferred. Masthead descriptor renamed `.h .tag` → `.h .subtitle` (specimen chrome, not a
  component). Live Tags descender clip fixed via ds-005. Specimen: `reviews/TAG-COMPONENT-2026-07-18`.
  **ds-005 now GATED + CLOSED (07-19):** `_validate_descender_clip.py` (step 27/34) forces
  `text-box-edge:text text` on every truncating label; the button follow-on audit found `.btn`/`.cta`/`.qbtn`
  CLEAN (they never truncate — null result), the real debt was 7 labels in Tranche-2/3/4/7/8 + Masthead
  `.dd-title`/`.navitem-tx`, all fixed zero-waivers. Removing an override now reds the build.
- ~~**`.num` at 24px**~~ **RULED T-D14 (2026-07-19):** added `.t-cm-figure-3` (24/500) to the ramp;
  countdown numeral bound via class; build green (34 steps). Multi-size 20/24/32 lands with countdown size variants.
- **Family A (reverse on near-black), 12 decls** — held at 500. Re-specimen on a FULL dark surface.

### Gates owed — rules that exist but do not bite
- **Amber rules 1 + 2** (R-D3) · **type.css load order** · **DEF-006** (see above) · dark-mode green
  `#1AA05C` 3.37 · dark-mode red/blue as TEXT glyphs on `#111` (3.97 / 4.15).

### ⚠️ METHOD DEBT — the review overlay loses row identity
Three sheets needed three different disambiguation routes; one (RAG-MATTING) is unresolvable. **The
overlay should capture which row a comment is pinned to.** A PRODUCT fix, not a process workaround —
registered against the review-layer-as-product thread (and `_FUTURE-STATE.md` feature ideas).

- **🔴 GAP (2026-07-17, measured) — the library does NOT use the canon type ramp.** Type was promoted
  and the *grid* retrofit ran, but components were never rebound: **0 of 50** files reference a
  `.t-cm-*`/`.t-ed-*` composite; raw font declarations remain everywhere (canon.css 113, T8 43, T1
  25, T6 23…). **THE TYPE RETROFIT (sibling to the grid retrofit) — NOT STARTED:** (1) components
  link/inline `type.css`; (2) rebind every text declaration — Component for single-line, Editorial
  for wrapping prose (the N1 caveat decides); (3) snap off-ramp sizes; (4) wire
  `_validate_type_composites.py` into the build (Dave: *"we need to hard wire this"*).
  ⚠️ `canon.css` is GENERATED from snippets between the AUTO markers — edit snippets and regenerate,
  never hand-retype. Scope ≈ the grid retrofit; needs a fresh session.
- **✅ Icon SOURCE canvas normalised to 18×18** (2026-07-17, ruled option A — fix the assets, we own
  the library). Library now **652 × 18×18** + 6 deliberate non-square utility marks; build green;
  renders identical. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-17-type-token-build.md`.
- **🔵 SCHEDULED (Dave 2026-07-17) — ICON SCALE onto the 4px grid** (step 0 above done). Icon render
  sizes were never snapped and DEF-005's square-exemption can't see them. Measured: ~56 usages
  on-grid, **~50 OFF** (18px ×20, 14px ×14, 22px ×7, 26/34/11/15/10 tail). **The work:**
  (1) sanctioned icon scale on 4px = **12/16/20/24/32/36/40/44** (36·40·44 added by Dave — 44 = WCAG
  target-size floor); rule the mapping per off-grid size **against renders, not on paper** (Dave's
  call — optical weight); (2) **tie icon box → the type grid-slot** (icon beside a label takes the
  SAME slot — the rule that makes the scale self-evident); (3) source-artwork caveat: the ~71
  non-square assets need a `preserveAspectRatio`/pad-to-square ruling; (4) gate it — narrow DEF-005's
  exemption or add `_validate_icon_scale.py`; (5) retrofit the ~50, re-render. NOT started.

- **🟢 RULE 16 (2026-07-16) — component documentation is part of "done":** Swiss dossier in
  `reviews/` + graph-connected KB model doc in `_proforma/` (typed `relations:`). FIRM going forward.
  Exemplar: the Masthead pair. **Backlog (Dave "we might have to go back"):** retrofit docs for
  T1–T7; stand up the Swiss component catalog ("nicer Storybook") as their shared home.
- **🟡 PARKED — round-one DataViz kit BUILT + reviewed, "good enough for now", NOT signed off**
  (RULED Dave 2026-07-16). Gate-first: `_validate_dataviz.py` (9 blocking + 5 advisory) wired; whole
  kit on `knowledge/_proforma/DataViz-interactive.html`; **nine review rounds enacted** — ledger
  `knowledge/_proforma/_DATAVIZ-DECISIONS.md` (read before touching charts). **REVISIT target, not
  DONE:** Dave will add Layer-2 interaction controls (filtering, chart titles…) and finish sign-off.
  Interactivity never render-checked in a browser by Dave — needs his in-browser pass. Staleness:
  flip to DONE only on his sign-off.
- **DataViz foundations — RATIFIED + PROMOTED (2026-07-16):** method dossier ratified (semantic SVG +
  tokens + CSS motion + hidden-table spine; canvas rejected); **V7 promoted into

  per-chart rebind) · `data/delta/{gain,loss,neutral,warning}` (D2, value-split pairs); **`{#dv-019}`
  recorded** (scoped gain/loss exception + the vibrating-boundaries rule, thresholds 1.25 / 135° /
  0.5 adopted advisory — quantified because Dave OBSERVED the dance on a 146° pair); suggestion
  ranges stay `proposed` in `tokens/_proposals/dataviz-ranges.proposals.json`. **NEXT = round-one kit

  (L1 exposed · L1 + mega · Trigger mega), drill-down drawer variant, all gates green. Supersedes the
  T7 `gheader` + `mm-masthead` demos. Two provisional glyphs (`i-brand-apollo` crescent,
  `i-menu-search`) await real assets — `knowledge/_ICON-GAPS.md`. Design revisit possible later.
  History (six review rounds): `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-masthead-rounds.md`.
- **⚠️ PROPAGATION GAP (partially closed):** `ADR-0006` + `notes/_VISION-iteration-machine_2026-07-03.html`
  still speak the OLD looks-language ("cool/warm/hot register switch"; the mock has a
  `border-radius:10px` cardinal violation). `_TEST-BRIEF-v2` §2 was reconciled 07-05; the vision doc
  + ADR-0006 remain open — do when next in that area.

- **Worked spread — DONE 2026-07-05, two instances (Sonnet + Opus re-run).** First
  retrieve/extend/invent spread; cardinal curbs held; Dave found two real gaps, fixed same session
  (canon rigour tier `.cn-*` > `.c-*`; Opus re-run). Writeups in
  `knowledge/_fitness-test/register-spread-2026-07-05*/`. Still not "proven" — one screen.
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md`.
- **🟠 GENERATION SHAPE — RULED (Dave, 2026-07-10): rule-tuning + inference tiering LEAD; the
  double-pass is a component, not the architecture.** The two-pass restyle was "not all that
  successful" — an interesting hypothesis, no more. Future state affirmed: **strict mode over a full
  component suite for the "factory"**. The trace tool (`knowledge/_trace_knowledge_usage.py`) showed
  governed output is already PURE-RETRIEVAL — tuning must change *what the rules ask for*, not
  adherence. **ROOT CAUSE of flat layouts: the library stops at organism — ZERO templates/shells** —
  the layout-governance gap and the library-tier gap are the SAME gap ([[library-composition-tier-gap]]).
  **OPEN DECISION F7:** build-upfront vs cluster-compound. **Working plan (agreed direction):**
  housecleaning → gap-analysis targets across three tiers (templates/shells = the load-bearing zero
  tier) → prove the loop on ONE cluster → build the template tier + compose gate → scale compounding.
  Full chain + all three hypotheses: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-07-s9-root-cause-and-ruling.md` +

  parts (Dave, 2026-07-18) — registered in `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.

  tooling) · mode-B brand self-check · the mode dial.

- **✅ Decision-corpus audit — TIER A CLEAN 2026-07-05** (ADR-0007 §5; method
  `_RUNBOOK-decision-audit.md`; ledger `_DECISION-AUDIT.md` — per-batch verdicts live there).
  Milestone: every Tier A node has a verdict — retires the "everything is unaudited" risk for
  foundational nodes. **Standing follow-ups:** §9 proof-obligation · ADR-0003 KG/ingestion · §4
  language-strip · TOV content audit · harness-modes exploration · re-audit the two amended nodes
  (ADR-0006, `derivation-governance` — amended text re-enters `unaudited`) · staged-promotion /
  extension-library process (direction VOUCHED, mechanism DEFERRED; tiered-access feature idea →
  `_FUTURE-STATE.md`). Next: Tier B opportunistically, Tier C by sample/on-touch. Never in a loaded
  session.
- **⭐ Harness modes + dials exploration** (from the 07-05 defer): flexible to a degree — clean
  switch or toggle + advanced mode, maybe "let it rip"; **finding the use cases is the important
  part**; research + iterate, start small. Own thread. Memory `harness-two-modes`.
- **⭐ TOV = digital-editorial spin-off + future content audit** (§4b defer): genuinely useful for
  DIGITAL EDITORIAL — candidate spin-off; for interfaces NOT a priority except neutral decisions
  (labelling, locale, formality). Memory `tone-of-voice-ingest`.
- **⭐ Charter §4 language-strip (HARD follow-up):** strip §4's interpretive prose
  (recall-by-adjective), leaving the four curbs as KG-sourced derivations — **do inside the
  unified-KG/ingestion thread, not standalone.** Amended text re-enters `unaudited`.
- **⭐ Unified DS knowledge-graph + ingestion, done right** (from ADR-0003 defer). The whole corpus is
  one interlinked graph; today that lives only in the compliance index. **Design direction (Dave,
  2026-07-10):** the compliance "KG" is an inverted index, fine for its job, wrong for the roadmap.
  When taken up: (1) **NOT GraphRAG** — overlay/property graph over existing stores, edge layer
  derived + regenerable, no monolith; (2) granularity = typed EDGES, not finer text (split only
  bundled rules — ACT atomic-vs-composite); (3) **import** the SC↔rule leg (ACT Rules Format 1.1 +
  axe-core metadata), hand-curate only component↔SC (our genuine novelty); (4) type edges
  `applies_to` vs `verified_by` — the queryable form of "enforced vs asserted"; (5) keep structural
  graph separate from advisory retrieval-over-prose. **Sequencing:** rides with the layout/library
  tier (R4) + Ingestion Phase 3 — not standalone infra. Cheap-now slice: type existing edges + import
  ACT. Memory `ds-knowledge-graph-revisit`. Unaudited.
- **Seaworthiness plan — DONE 2026-07-05** → `notes/_SEAWORTHINESS-PLAN_2026-07-05.md` (the
  dependency-aware sequence; partly overtaken by the pro-forma pivot). Phase 0 ingestion-tracking
  hygiene CLOSED same date. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md`.
- **D2 — novel-screen test — THE #1 unlock.** Waiting on a colleague's brief (their brief-v2 + own
  baseline + signed contract *before* generation). `notes/_TEST-PLAN-novel-screen-proof.md`.
- **Toolkit tranche 2** (Dropdowns ×4) — parallel cheap-model workstream. Memory
  `common-toolkit-survey`.

## PLANNED / TARGET STATES — in-flight targets (per the ADR-0007 extension)

*Intended end-states with a path. Ideas not yet in flight live in **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`**.*

- **🎯 Full consolidated review page (Apollo Mono baseline)** — Dave reviews the whole Mono baseline in **ONE
  big review page when the build-out is "done"**, not piecemeal (*"I just need to get this nailed"*, 2026-07-19).
  Running backlog + method: `knowledge/_REVIEW-SIGNOFF.md` top block. Covers T1–T9 as they render post-tokenise,
  the tokenise deltas (divider `#3A3A3A→#808080` · blue focus · near-white primary), and the open decisions
  (mono primary-action token · success mono-vs-teal · focus blue-vs-mono) + DataViz sign-off + T9 first review.
  Memory `full-review-pending`.

- **🎯 Gates-as-a-service → close the agentic loop** (Dave 2026-07-14). Expose Apollo's validators as
  callable tools (MCP) so a host agent runs them mid-task (generate → check → fix → re-check) — the
  verifier is the expensive, differentiated half, already built. Removes the per-designer Python
  blocker. *Honesty:* the repair loop is not built; gates verify DECLARED obligations only. Memory
  `agentic-loop-gates-as-service`. Unaudited.
- **🎯 Chat-to-the-KB bot** (Dave 2026-07-17). Conversational agent over the Apollo KB (canon ·
  criteria · rulings · decision graph) for designers/devs/stakeholders. Open: retrieval grounding +
  citations, scope, surface, guardrails. **The consult index (2026-07-18) is its seed — same index,
  read side built once, used twice.** Memory `chat-to-kb-bot`. Unaudited.
- **🎯 Ingestion "done right"** — full detail: `knowledge/_INGESTION-ASSESSMENT_2026-07-05.md`
  (cockroach doc). Target: every ingested entity addressable in one overlay graph; tokens
  Sutherland-canonical, 147 deprecates retired; completeness = edge coverage. Sutherland export is NO
  LONGER a blocker (arrived 06-17). Path: Phase 1 token migration → Phase 2 finish guidelines →
  Phase 3 overlay graph (= the 07-10 KG design direction above) → Phase 4 wire coverage into this
  machine.

## SPIN-OFF / GENERALISABLE CANDIDATES — surface, don't bury (Dave, 2026-07-05)

*Tools/methods that may generalise — treat like company spin-offs. Surface mid-chat; don't force it.
Memory `spin-off-candidates`. Sibling register for ideas/side-quests: `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.*

- **🌱 The state machine** (`_LIVE-STATE` + `_FUTURE-STATE` + `_DECISION-HISTORY` + decision-audit
  method) — **Dave's first named candidate.** A portable "how a long-running agent project retains
  state, records supersession, and audits its own decisions" kit.
- **🌱 The FONT AUDIT instrument** (2026-07-18, `reviews/gen_univers_dossier.py` + fontTools passes):
  answers "is this face tight or loose relative to its own stroke weight; is our commissioned cut
  actually stock?" with numbers. Settled in ten minutes a weeks-open question and relocated a defect
  to the foundry (ds-004). Unruled; embedded in a dossier generator, would need extracting.
- **🌱 REAL-FONT EMBEDDING for review sheets** (2026-07-18, `embed_fonts()` in
  `gen_tracking_contact_sheet.py`): base64 woff2 inlining so specimens render in the brand face
  anywhere. Retired the "judge on your screen" caveat. **Candidate to fold into `_make_review.py`.**
- Other candidates (unruled): decision-audit runbook · fixed/flex charter pattern ·
  ingestion→overlay-KG method · review-dossier language-review instrument ·
  verification=enforcement gate-tiering · the cockroach-doc pattern. Precedent:
  `digital-experience-transformation`, `graphify-tool`.

- **Capture ritual** — canonical at `knowledge/_RUNBOOK-capture-ritual.md`; run every session, no
  exceptions. The enforcing `_capture_gate.py` is deferred to the PM-KG MVP.
