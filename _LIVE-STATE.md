# _LIVE-STATE — what's true now (cold-start spine)

*The supersession ledger for the project: what's **LIVE**, what's **DEAD** (don't build on it), what's
**OPEN**, plus in-flight **TARGETS**. Read this second, after `GOOD-MORNING.md`, before
`knowledge/README.md`. Per **ADR-0007**. ⚠️ **INTERIM — hand-maintained** until `_build_live_state.py`
generates it from front-matter edges + tombstones. Refresh at end of every session alongside the
handoff — and **stamp the date from `date`, never from the session's own belief** (the T-D12 handoff
mis-dated itself a day forward; commit timestamps caught it).*

*Siblings: **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`** — side-quests, feature ideas, resurrection candidates (the forward
half of the state machine, Dave's ask 2026-07-18) · **`_DECISION-HISTORY/`** — dated per-thread
narrative, relocated verbatim (how we got here; see its README for the rules + RESURRECT tags).*

> **SPINE DISCIPLINE (ruled 2026-07-18, Fable consolidation session — supersedes the "1044 lines"
> banner):** state lines live here; **narrative longer than ~10 lines goes to `_DECISION-HISTORY/` at
> write time, in the same pass.** Split entries end `History: _DECISION-HISTORY/<file>`. Advisory
> tripwire ~500 lines. Edits to this file are reachability-relevant — run
> `python3 knowledge/_validate_standing_instructions.py` (STAND-002) after touching it.

*Last refreshed: **2026-07-19 — "A gate for the blast radius": blast-radius gate built (closes open-001), h2 namespaced, specimen chrome harmonised, ds-005 logged, Tag atom (3 variants × 2 sizes) wired**. Previous: **2026-07-18 late** — R-D4 matting rungs ruled + first RAG role-token promotion. Earlier: **2026-07-18 Fable consolidation** — consolidated
1104 → ~450 lines per the classification Dave ruled via markup (11 pins) on
`reviews/CONSOLIDATION-AUDIT-2026-07-18.html`. Nothing deleted: ~580 lines relocated verbatim to
`_DECISION-HISTORY/`, duplicates reduced to pointers, two entries removed on their own recorded
instructions. Prior refresh: T-D12 ruling, commit `9fb1381`.*

## 🕓 OPEN — Latin Univers **WEBFONT**: waiting on brand (raised 2026-07-18, reframed same week)

> **DOWNGRADED from ⛔ BLOCKING to 🕓 WAITING.** Dave: *"the license will be renewed soon, it may well
> have been already, the webfont needed Ultralight added, I think this is only procedural, and low
> risk."* **The commercial judgement is his and recorded as made — do not re-litigate it.**

**Split the question in two. Only one half is about risk.**

**(1) LICENCE — procedural, pending, low-risk. Owner: BRAND, chased by Dave.** The renewal is in
flight; the delta is a *weight* (**Ultralight**) being added. Write **"renewal pending; Dave assesses
the gap as procedural and low-risk"** — never "we have no licence".

**(2) ASSETS — unchanged, and NOT a risk question.** Verified by inventory: **zero Latin
`.woff`/`.woff2` files exist in the repo** (five script packs present; Latin has none). A favourable
licence does not deliver files — shareable real-face material stays blocked until the pack physically
lands, because there is nothing to embed.

**✅ DISTRIBUTION — CLOSED, ruled "leave".** The four tracked files embedding base64 woff2 stay. No
`git rm --cached`, no BFG, no history rewrite. Repo is private (confirmed by Dave) and shared only to
HSBC employees — every recipient sits inside HSBC's own licence. Interim control retained:
`reviews/*CONTACT*.html` gitignored; share OUTSIDE HSBC as PDF only.

**WHAT CLEARS THIS:** (1) **files land** — `HSBC_MtUnivers_Latin-*.woff/.woff2` in
`knowledge/assets/fonts/` (this alone unblocks shareable material); (2) **brand confirms whether
Ultralight is in scope** — ⚠️ not a detail: the packs ship Th/Lt/Rg/Md/Bd ≡ 100/300/400/500/700, so
Ultralight is a **sixth weight below Thin → a change to the canon ramp → a TYPE RULING, not an asset
drop.** Expect it; don't discover it in a diff.

**Provenance corrections, kept loud (full record: `knowledge/_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`
§ Blockers 1):** I struck this blocker as "false" and Dave caught it. And
`WebfontUserGuide-2024.pdf` is **generic Monotype guidance, not an entitlement record** — "we hold no
Latin webfont" rests on absence of files, not on any document.

## LIVE — current truth (in force)

### ⭐ TYPE and BOX are SEPARATE — T-D12, RULED + VERIFIED across 21 files (2026-07-18)
- **Two lists, two questions.** `.t-cm-<size>` = TYPE (family, size, weight, **`line-height:1`**) —
  **safe to bind anywhere.** `.t-cm-slot` = BOX (`display:inline-flex`, `align-items`, `min-height`,
  cap-trim) — **opt-in**, bound ONLY where the element already declares a flex display.
- **`--slot` carries the slot height on the type composite.** A custom property is inert unless read,
  so a type-only binding has no box consequence. That is what makes the two lists independent.
- **`line-height` is TYPE, not BOX** — Component tier *is* "single-line at line-height 1". This was
  not the question the queue asked and it is the one that decided the batch: with line-height in the
  box, type-only bindings silently DROPPED the `/1` the old shorthand carried.
- **Cap-trim reaches elements that lacked it, and the shift is ACCEPTED** — refusing it would leave
  two classes of button in canon.
- **The slot test stays conservative.** "Already declares flex" is the OBSERVED condition `.btn` met,
  not a theory. **Slotting anything else is a per-component decision with its own diff, never a
  mechanical sweep.** Widening it is a ruling.
- Evidence: 13/21 pixel-identical, 0 page-height changes, real HSBC Univers. Ledger:
  `_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md` **T-D12**; sheet `reviews/TYPE-BOX-SPLIT-2026-07-18.html`.
  Validation state: **unaudited**.
- **METHOD, reusable:** the `NO_SNAP=1` isolation control in `apply_type_bind.py` separated diffs the
  binding CAUSED from diffs T-D10 INTENDED. **A diff you cannot attribute is not evidence.** Reach for
  a control before reaching for a verdict.

### Type binding — RULED + PROVEN on one component (2026-07-18)
- **Mechanism = (d) selector-list extension, HAND-MAINTAINED.** A component binds by being appended
  to its composite's selector list in `canon/type.css`. Plain CSS: no generator, no build step, no
  markup change. `type-bindings.json` + orphan gate = an OPTIONAL later upgrade, **explicitly
  deferred — do not build**. Ledger: `_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md` T-D9.
- **`.t-cm` is variant D.** Cap-trim sits on the **ELEMENT**; the former required `.txt` child is
  **GONE**. `inline-flex` + `align-items:center` centres the cap box in a taller slot — an
  `inline-block` variant TOP-ALIGNS and is wrong. Observed in real HSBC Univers. Supersedes the
  07-17 composite.
- **⚠️ LOAD ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.** `.t-cm-button` and `.btn` are both specificity 0-1-0 → source
  order decides. **`type.css` must load BEFORE component CSS.** Not yet gated.
- **Delivery = `<link>`, NOT inlining.** The portable unit is the PROJECT, not the file (Dave: *"the
  entire project must be portable… a package, pulled from a repo"*). The 49-file inline sweep was
  solving a problem that does not exist.
- **`type.css` is HAND-AUTHORED.** The "generated" header was false provenance; removed.
- **Bound so far: `.btn` only**, pixel-diff verified as a no-op.
- **Unchanged from 07-17:** CSS cap-trim · 4px slot · slot min `ceil(cap + 2·descender)` snapped to
  4px · descender guard baked INTO the slot · stacks use `gap`, **never padding**.

### RAG — amber SOLVED, background/glyph split (2026-07-18)
- **Two tokens per hue: `background` (fills) + `glyph` (icons, arrows, text).** Red/green/blue hold
  the SAME value in both roles; **only amber diverges**. Ledger: `_proforma/_RAG-DECISIONS.md`.
- **`amber/background` = `#F0B13A`** — ink on it 9.16. **`amber/graphic` = `#C58900`** — 3.02 on
  white, 6.25 on `#111`; required by `{#dv-016}` (≥3:1 series fills, blocking).
- **Rule 1 — amber is always paired with black text. Rule 2 — amber is not a DIRECTIONAL delta
  colour**; it remains valid for status and tolerance.
- **White is the RAG text colour universally; dark-text variant DROPPED** (R-D1) — amber the sole
  exception, always was.
- **`#000000` retained in the KB as brand source of truth**; `#1A1A1A` = digital black for screens;
  `#1D1D1D` dropped; `#333333` canon, stays.
- **Incumbent RAG values NOT deleted** — retired into a future legacy theme. Tombstone, keep.
- **R-D4 (2026-07-18): matting rungs RULED — green + blue matted 15%** (`#2B7E4F` / `#306EC6`),
  red as-is, one level across both. **Role tokens PROMOTED** into `semantic-colour.json` as
  `rag/<hue>-background` + `rag/<hue>-glyph` (additive; incumbents untouched; zero components
  rebound yet — rebinding waits for the blast-radius gate). Green promoted **light-only**: the
  contrast gate refused the known-failing incumbent dark (3.37) — dark leaf lands with the
  dark-green ruling. Gate model gained `RULED_PAIR_EXCLUSIONS` (white text × amber fill is
  forbidden by rule 1, so the audit no longer tests it). Ledger: R-D4.
- **⚠️ NOT YET GATED.** Both amber rules are mechanically checkable and unenforced.

- **Project name = Apollo** (renamed from *Promenaut* repo-wide 2026-07-14; "Apollo" singular
  preferred, "Apollo SDS" acceptable). History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-14-rename-and-restructure.md`.
- **Red rule = red is the PRIMARY-action accent, used ONCE per screen** (RULED Dave 2026-07-14) —
  **NOT destructive-only.** Destructive/error takes a distinct, non-red treatment. Supersedes the
  charter §4 register-tied ceiling → now universal. `BRAND-1` gate rewritten accordingly.
  **Propagation gap (OPEN):** historical fitness-test builds + proof-001 `_GATE2-REPORT.md` still
  state the old rule — regenerate if revived. Memory `apollo-rename-and-red-rule-2026-07-14`.
- **Designer pack = shipped-ready** (2026-07-14). `designer-skills-v1/` (4 skills + built KB,
  gitignored); handover artifact **`Apollo-designer-skills.zip`**. Delivery via VS Code + Copilot
  Agent Skills; no Python for v1. Intro ~the 20th; hands-on the 24th. **Untested:** live-fire on a
  designer's machine — top release risk.
- **Working model = land to the live repo as-you-go** (RULED 2026-07-14). Deliverables write straight
  to the connected repo; the `/tmp/ux` snapshot is stale — don't trust it. GitHub Desktop CLOSED
  during Claude commits. Memory `working-model-cloud-vs-device`.
- **Repo restructured for human-readability** (2026-07-14) — root = operating essentials; visual map
  `docs/repo-map.html`. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-14-rename-and-restructure.md`.

- **Component library = Apollo pro-forma programme, in flight.** ONE component skeleton, N modes —
  **Apollo mono** (monochrome base; *"pro-forma" = Apollo mono*) · **Apollo UI** (branded HSBC) ·
  **Apollo SC** (prior branded — "keep the ideas, don't copy the solutions"). **FOUNDATIONAL RULING
  (Dave 2026-07-15):** no hardcoded styling — everything tokenised, sibling libraries governed by
  MODES; enforced by DEF-003 (no JS motion) + DEF-004 (no raw px) in `_build_all.py`.
  **Tranches T1–T8 built + gated** in `knowledge/_proforma/` (interactive one-file-per-tranche);
  rules live in `_PROFORMA-RULES.md` (16 rules, incl. rule 16: every component ships Swiss dossier +
  KB model doc). Reviewable build list =
  `reviews/ITINERARY-2026-07-14-apollo-component-library.{html,xlsx}` (124 items; ~50 real base gaps;
  extend-not-restart). Memory [[proforma-programme]].
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-15-proforma-tranche-arc.md`.
- **TYPE-TOKEN SYSTEM = PROMOTED TO CANON + grid enforced library-wide** (2026-07-17, Dave "crack
  on"): (1) primitives → `tokens/typography.json` + composites → `tokens/typography-composites.json`,
  `type.css` settled; (2) HSBC-general incumbent type+spacing parked as sibling sets — Apollo = the
  proposed HSBC standard, governed by modes; (3) **DEF-005** grid gate wired; (4) retrofit — 230
  off-grid snaps across canon.css + 38 snippets + 9 tranches; (5) vertical-stack rule drafted;
  (6) arrow asset RETIRED; (7) DEF-005 expanded to 50 files, all PASS. Rulings + WHY in
  `knowledge/_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`.
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-17-type-token-build.md`.
- **ATOMISE — build at the true atomic level, compose up** (RULED Dave 2026-07-14). Rolled-up
  patterns are a **debt**, not the model; build atoms → molecules → organisms per the `meta.schema`
  ladder. Known debt: decompose existing rolled-up molecules later. Applies to all new work.

- **Apollo product spine = "lovable on rails" · four phases** (Dave 2026-07-17; labels provisional,
  shape is the vision). **1 · Discover** (ingest/research; chat-to-KB bot likely here) ·
  **2 · Create** (being built now; four modes: **Strict** "Factory" · **Creative** · **Component
  Dev** · **Explore**) · **3 · Craft** (the review doc + comment overlay IS this phase) ·
  **4 · Dispatch** (hand to engineering; may fold away). **The four Create modes = TIERED LEVELS OF
  ADHERENCE** to the rails, guardrails progressively removed, per-tier sub-settings. **a11y (WCAG
  2.2 AA) IS the single non-removable floor** across every mode (per FOUNDATIONAL
  `accessibility-aspiration`) — "non-removable" = LOCKED, not HARDCODED: an **admin access layer**
  tunes every setting incl. the floor. **Apollo = the MOONSHOT** (name rationale). Memory
  `apollo-product-framing`. Unaudited — a framing, not a spec.
- **Product = a *flexing* engine** — one governed core, dials per work-type; floor/churn vs
  ceiling/novel. `ADR-0006`.
- **Output modes = a first-class dial** (Dave 2026-07-05): two fidelity tiers — portable dumb-HTML
  prototypes + build-ready from a prebuilt library, with **Sutherland** *a* target, not *the*
  architecture. Two-way tie: dark-mode work feeds INTO Sutherland; the Figma library IS Sutherland's
  working file. Memories `output-modes-portability`, `sutherland-figma-mapping`. Unaudited.
- **Register = an inference ramp** (NOT a look): sober = retrieve · balanced = extend · expressive =
  invent. Charter `_FIXED-FLEX-CHARTER.md` **§9**.
- **§9a — provenance of "reads HSBC"**: brand-ness resolves to named sources; flag-where-silent is
  advisory; residual gestalt = human. Record: `knowledge/_PROVENANCE-inference-levels_2026-07-04.md`.
- **Two harness modes** (§9a): converge/ship = mode B ADOPTED · explore/noodle = mode A OPEN. Memory
  `harness-two-modes`.
- **Project memory = temporal decision-graph pattern; this file is the cold-start spine.** `ADR-0007`.
- **Supersession discipline · git split · data hygiene** — canonical in `AGENTS.md` (tombstone +
  propagation log in the same pass; Claude commits in terminal, Dave pushes via GitHub Desktop only).
- **Build** — `python3 knowledge/_build_all.py` is the one command; the gate list lives in the script
  and in `GOOD-MORNING.md` §A. (This entry previously carried a third, drifted copy of the list.)
- **State machine records FUTURE/TARGET states too** (RULED 2026-07-05, extends ADR-0007): targets
  carry what · why · blockers · source; the staleness gate must flag a target whose blockers cleared.
  **Extended 2026-07-18:** the forward half now has its own home — **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`** (side-quests,
  ideas, resurrection candidates); in-flight TARGETS stay below. Unaudited node.

## SUPERSEDED / DEAD — do not build on

- `knowledge/_fitness-test/sme-payments-registers.html` — old looks-based register dial → superseded
  by charter §9 (2026-07-05). Tombstoned.
- Register-as-"described-look" — → superseded by §9 inference ramp (2026-07-03).
- Terminal-only push (07-02) — → superseded by the git split (07-05).
- `knowledge/_NEXT-SESSION.md` — retired → `GOOD-MORNING.md`.
- **`knowledge/_agent-memory/store/` — the memory mirror — DELETED 2026-07-18 (RULED Dave, via
  consolidation review pin 11).** It had become the third source of truth its own README forbids
  (115 stored vs 110 live, five ghosts, knowingly stale by three more). Final dated snapshot:
  **`_retired/agent-memory-snapshot-2026-07-18/`** (tombstone-bannered, non-authoritative, never
  refreshed). Capture-ritual step 3 amended: durable content is INSCRIBED properly (rules →
  guidelines/runbooks · checkable facts → assertions · rulings → ledgers), never photocopied.
  Propagation: runbook rewritten; snapshot README carries the tombstone; memory `capture-ritual`
  updated.
- **The "stale-reading pattern" spine note (07-18) — tombstoned 2026-07-18**, superseded by the
  **consult mechanism** (ruled via consolidation review pin 10): problem-domain index + pre-flight
  receipt, spec at `reviews/CONSOLIDATION-AUDIT-2026-07-18.html` §3, landing as
  `knowledge/_consult.py` + `_RUNBOOK-consult.md`. The bite-rule ("check the KB and the gates BEFORE
  designing") lives in `GOOD-MORNING.md` §A until the tool makes it mechanical.

## OPEN — propagation gaps + parked threads

### ✅ CLOSED (2026-07-18) — the binding mechanism's BLAST RADIUS now has a gate
`_validate_type_blast_radius.py` (blocking, wired into `_build_all.py`) + registry
`canon/_type-bindings.json`. Bites on any UNREGISTERED / ESCAPED / UNWAIVED-BARE appended selector;
current debt registered + waived so it lands green. Full ruling + v1 limits: **T-D13** in
`_proforma/_TYPE-DECISIONS.md`. Residual DEBT to burn down (non-`/1` batch): namespace `h2` (25
files) then the scoped-element set — tracked there, not here.

### 🟠 OPEN — the non-`/1` batch, and why DEF-006 stays unwired
**61 non-`/1` font shorthands remain in `snippets/`**; the bulk of the remaining **690 TYPE-002** sit
in the pro-forma tranches, carrying line-heights 1.1–1.6 — binding REPLACES them with canon and
**things move**. Needs its own reviewed batch with T-D12's before/after pixel discipline.
**DEF-006 is 780 → 729 and stays UNWIRED until this lands** — wiring it earlier trains everyone to
ignore a red build.

### Awaiting Dave — small, no analysis needed
- ~~Matting rung for green + blue~~ — **RULED R-D4 (2026-07-18): both matted 15%** (`#2B7E4F` /
  `#306EC6`), red as-is; role tokens promoted (see LIVE → RAG). Rung came from a direct readback —
  the pin export named the hue, not the row (the overlay row-identity debt biting again).
- **`{#dv-017}`(a) CONTRADICTION** — permits red/green for deltas while naming "RAG-style cells";
  RAG includes amber. The rule permits a palette it also excludes.
- ~~**`.tag` COLLISION**~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-18.** Was three things under one name: the tag component
  (14px), a smaller reuse (12px), and a masthead descriptor `.h .tag`. Ruled (Dave): tag atom = 3
  variants (dismissible/bordered/plain) × 2 sizes (`.tag`/`.tag--sm`), `.tag--plain` for borderless;
  colour/RAG deferred. Masthead descriptor renamed `.h .tag` → `.h .subtitle` (specimen chrome, not a
  component). Live Tags descender clip fixed via ds-005. Specimen: `reviews/TAG-COMPONENT-2026-07-18`.
- **`.num` at 24px/400** — no Component rung at 24px (ramp: 12/14/16/20/32/40/52). Add or snap?
- **Family A (reverse on near-black), 12 decls** — held at 500. Re-specimen on a FULL dark surface.

### Gates owed — rules that exist but do not bite
- **Amber rules 1 + 2** (R-D3) · **type.css load order** · **DEF-006** (see above) · dark-mode green
  `#1AA05C` 3.37 · dark-mode red/blue as TEXT glyphs on `#111` (3.97 / 4.15).

### ⚠️ METHOD DEBT — the review overlay loses row identity
Three sheets needed three different disambiguation routes; one (RAG-MATTING) is unresolvable. **The
overlay should capture which row a comment is pinned to.** A PRODUCT fix, not a process workaround —
registered against the review-layer-as-product thread (and `_FUTURE-STATE.md` feature ideas).

- **🔴 GAP (2026-07-17, measured) — the library does NOT use the canon type ramp.** Type was promoted
  and the *grid* retrofit ran, but components were never rebound: **0 of 50** files reference a
  `.t-cm-*`/`.t-ed-*` composite; raw font declarations remain everywhere (canon.css 113, T8 43, T1
  25, T6 23…). **THE TYPE RETROFIT (sibling to the grid retrofit) — NOT STARTED:** (1) components
  link/inline `type.css`; (2) rebind every text declaration — Component for single-line, Editorial
  for wrapping prose (the N1 caveat decides); (3) snap off-ramp sizes; (4) wire
  `_validate_type_composites.py` into the build (Dave: *"we need to hard wire this"*).
  ⚠️ `canon.css` is GENERATED from snippets between the AUTO markers — edit snippets and regenerate,
  never hand-retype. Scope ≈ the grid retrofit; needs a fresh session.
- **✅ Icon SOURCE canvas normalised to 18×18** (2026-07-17, ruled option A — fix the assets, we own
  the library). Library now **652 × 18×18** + 6 deliberate non-square utility marks; build green;
  renders identical. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-17-type-token-build.md`.
- **🔵 SCHEDULED (Dave 2026-07-17) — ICON SCALE onto the 4px grid** (step 0 above done). Icon render
  sizes were never snapped and DEF-005's square-exemption can't see them. Measured: ~56 usages
  on-grid, **~50 OFF** (18px ×20, 14px ×14, 22px ×7, 26/34/11/15/10 tail). **The work:**
  (1) sanctioned icon scale on 4px = **12/16/20/24/32/36/40/44** (36·40·44 added by Dave — 44 = WCAG
  target-size floor); rule the mapping per off-grid size **against renders, not on paper** (Dave's
  call — optical weight); (2) **tie icon box → the type grid-slot** (icon beside a label takes the
  SAME slot — the rule that makes the scale self-evident); (3) source-artwork caveat: the ~71
  non-square assets need a `preserveAspectRatio`/pad-to-square ruling; (4) gate it — narrow DEF-005's
  exemption or add `_validate_icon_scale.py`; (5) retrofit the ~50, re-render. NOT started.

- **🟢 RULE 16 (2026-07-16) — component documentation is part of "done":** Swiss dossier in
  `reviews/` + graph-connected KB model doc in `_proforma/` (typed `relations:`). FIRM going forward.
  Exemplar: the Masthead pair. **Backlog (Dave "we might have to go back"):** retrofit docs for
  T1–T7; stand up the Swiss component catalog ("nicer Storybook") as their shared home.
- **🟡 PARKED — round-one DataViz kit BUILT + reviewed, "good enough for now", NOT signed off**
  (RULED Dave 2026-07-16). Gate-first: `_validate_dataviz.py` (9 blocking + 5 advisory) wired; whole
  kit on `knowledge/_proforma/DataViz-interactive.html`; **nine review rounds enacted** — ledger
  `knowledge/_proforma/_DATAVIZ-DECISIONS.md` (read before touching charts). **REVISIT target, not
  DONE:** Dave will add Layer-2 interaction controls (filtering, chart titles…) and finish sign-off.
  Interactivity never render-checked in a browser by Dave — needs his in-browser pass. Staleness:
  flip to DONE only on his sign-off.
- **DataViz foundations — RATIFIED + PROMOTED (2026-07-16):** method dossier ratified (semantic SVG +
  tokens + CSS motion + hidden-table spine; canvas rejected); **V7 promoted into
  `semantic-colour.json`**: `data/series/1–5` (C, mode-stable) · `data/series-high-contrast/1–5` (A,
  per-chart rebind) · `data/delta/{gain,loss,neutral,warning}` (D2, value-split pairs); **`{#dv-019}`
  recorded** (scoped gain/loss exception + the vibrating-boundaries rule, thresholds 1.25 / 135° /
  0.5 adopted advisory — quantified because Dave OBSERVED the dance on a 146° pair); suggestion
  ranges stay `proposed` in `tokens/_proposals/dataviz-ranges.proposals.json`. **NEXT = round-one kit
  revisit** per the parked entry above. Dossier: `reviews/DATAVIZ-METHOD-2026-07-16.html`.
  History (the rev 1→3 arc): `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-dataviz-v7-arc.md`. Presentation
  candidate: see `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.
- **🟢 Masthead — SHIPPED as an MLP** (review complete, Dave "done at last", 2026-07-16; MLP status
  ruled 2026-07-18). `knowledge/_proforma/Masthead-interactive.html`: one `.masthead`, 3 recipes
  (L1 exposed · L1 + mega · Trigger mega), drill-down drawer variant, all gates green. Supersedes the
  T7 `gheader` + `mm-masthead` demos. Two provisional glyphs (`i-brand-apollo` crescent,
  `i-menu-search`) await real assets — `knowledge/_ICON-GAPS.md`. Design revisit possible later.
  History (six review rounds): `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-masthead-rounds.md`.
- **⚠️ PROPAGATION GAP (partially closed):** `ADR-0006` + `notes/_VISION-iteration-machine_2026-07-03.html`
  still speak the OLD looks-language ("cool/warm/hot register switch"; the mock has a
  `border-radius:10px` cardinal violation). `_TEST-BRIEF-v2` §2 was reconciled 07-05; the vision doc
  + ADR-0006 remain open — do when next in that area.

- **Worked spread — DONE 2026-07-05, two instances (Sonnet + Opus re-run).** First
  retrieve/extend/invent spread; cardinal curbs held; Dave found two real gaps, fixed same session
  (canon rigour tier `.cn-*` > `.c-*`; Opus re-run). Writeups in
  `knowledge/_fitness-test/register-spread-2026-07-05*/`. Still not "proven" — one screen.
  History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md`.
- **🟠 GENERATION SHAPE — RULED (Dave, 2026-07-10): rule-tuning + inference tiering LEAD; the
  double-pass is a component, not the architecture.** The two-pass restyle was "not all that
  successful" — an interesting hypothesis, no more. Future state affirmed: **strict mode over a full
  component suite for the "factory"**. The trace tool (`knowledge/_trace_knowledge_usage.py`) showed
  governed output is already PURE-RETRIEVAL — tuning must change *what the rules ask for*, not
  adherence. **ROOT CAUSE of flat layouts: the library stops at organism — ZERO templates/shells** —
  the layout-governance gap and the library-tier gap are the SAME gap ([[library-composition-tier-gap]]).
  **OPEN DECISION F7:** build-upfront vs cluster-compound. **Working plan (agreed direction):**
  housecleaning → gap-analysis targets across three tiers (templates/shells = the load-bearing zero
  tier) → prove the loop on ONE cluster → build the template tier + compose gate → scale compounding.
  Full chain + all three hypotheses: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-07-s9-root-cause-and-ruling.md` +
  `knowledge/_FINDINGS-s9-session-2026-07-07.md`. Deep review:
  `reviews/REVIEW-2026-07-10-deep-analysis_rev2.html`. Memory [[ruling-generation-shape-2026-07-10]].
  **RESURRECT:** the experiment lineage is future evaluation material once the factory has all its
  parts (Dave, 2026-07-18) — registered in `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.
- **Named-not-built harness machinery** (§9/§9a): isolated generation · divergence probe (formal
  tooling) · mode-B brand self-check · the mode dial.
- **PM-KG MVP** (`ADR-0007`): `_build_live_state.py` + the staleness gate + `_capture_gate.py` — own
  focused session.
- **✅ Decision-corpus audit — TIER A CLEAN 2026-07-05** (ADR-0007 §5; method
  `_RUNBOOK-decision-audit.md`; ledger `_DECISION-AUDIT.md` — per-batch verdicts live there).
  Milestone: every Tier A node has a verdict — retires the "everything is unaudited" risk for
  foundational nodes. **Standing follow-ups:** §9 proof-obligation · ADR-0003 KG/ingestion · §4
  language-strip · TOV content audit · harness-modes exploration · re-audit the two amended nodes
  (ADR-0006, `derivation-governance` — amended text re-enters `unaudited`) · staged-promotion /
  extension-library process (direction VOUCHED, mechanism DEFERRED; tiered-access feature idea →
  `_FUTURE-STATE.md`). Next: Tier B opportunistically, Tier C by sample/on-touch. Never in a loaded
  session.
- **⭐ Harness modes + dials exploration** (from the 07-05 defer): flexible to a degree — clean
  switch or toggle + advanced mode, maybe "let it rip"; **finding the use cases is the important
  part**; research + iterate, start small. Own thread. Memory `harness-two-modes`.
- **⭐ TOV = digital-editorial spin-off + future content audit** (§4b defer): genuinely useful for
  DIGITAL EDITORIAL — candidate spin-off; for interfaces NOT a priority except neutral decisions
  (labelling, locale, formality). Memory `tone-of-voice-ingest`.
- **⭐ Charter §4 language-strip (HARD follow-up):** strip §4's interpretive prose
  (recall-by-adjective), leaving the four curbs as KG-sourced derivations — **do inside the
  unified-KG/ingestion thread, not standalone.** Amended text re-enters `unaudited`.
- **⭐ Unified DS knowledge-graph + ingestion, done right** (from ADR-0003 defer). The whole corpus is
  one interlinked graph; today that lives only in the compliance index. **Design direction (Dave,
  2026-07-10):** the compliance "KG" is an inverted index, fine for its job, wrong for the roadmap.
  When taken up: (1) **NOT GraphRAG** — overlay/property graph over existing stores, edge layer
  derived + regenerable, no monolith; (2) granularity = typed EDGES, not finer text (split only
  bundled rules — ACT atomic-vs-composite); (3) **import** the SC↔rule leg (ACT Rules Format 1.1 +
  axe-core metadata), hand-curate only component↔SC (our genuine novelty); (4) type edges
  `applies_to` vs `verified_by` — the queryable form of "enforced vs asserted"; (5) keep structural
  graph separate from advisory retrieval-over-prose. **Sequencing:** rides with the layout/library
  tier (R4) + Ingestion Phase 3 — not standalone infra. Cheap-now slice: type existing edges + import
  ACT. Memory `ds-knowledge-graph-revisit`. Unaudited.
- **Seaworthiness plan — DONE 2026-07-05** → `notes/_SEAWORTHINESS-PLAN_2026-07-05.md` (the
  dependency-aware sequence; partly overtaken by the pro-forma pivot). Phase 0 ingestion-tracking
  hygiene CLOSED same date. History: `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md`.
- **D2 — novel-screen test — THE #1 unlock.** Waiting on a colleague's brief (their brief-v2 + own
  baseline + signed contract *before* generation). `notes/_TEST-PLAN-novel-screen-proof.md`.
- **Toolkit tranche 2** (Dropdowns ×4) — parallel cheap-model workstream. Memory
  `common-toolkit-survey`.

## PLANNED / TARGET STATES — in-flight targets (per the ADR-0007 extension)

*Intended end-states with a path. Ideas not yet in flight live in **`_FUTURE-STATE.md`**.*

- **🎯 Gates-as-a-service → close the agentic loop** (Dave 2026-07-14). Expose Apollo's validators as
  callable tools (MCP) so a host agent runs them mid-task (generate → check → fix → re-check) — the
  verifier is the expensive, differentiated half, already built. Removes the per-designer Python
  blocker. *Honesty:* the repair loop is not built; gates verify DECLARED obligations only. Memory
  `agentic-loop-gates-as-service`. Unaudited.
- **🎯 Chat-to-the-KB bot** (Dave 2026-07-17). Conversational agent over the Apollo KB (canon ·
  criteria · rulings · decision graph) for designers/devs/stakeholders. Open: retrieval grounding +
  citations, scope, surface, guardrails. **The consult index (2026-07-18) is its seed — same index,
  read side built once, used twice.** Memory `chat-to-kb-bot`. Unaudited.
- **🎯 Ingestion "done right"** — full detail: `knowledge/_INGESTION-ASSESSMENT_2026-07-05.md`
  (cockroach doc). Target: every ingested entity addressable in one overlay graph; tokens
  Sutherland-canonical, 147 deprecates retired; completeness = edge coverage. Sutherland export is NO
  LONGER a blocker (arrived 06-17). Path: Phase 1 token migration → Phase 2 finish guidelines →
  Phase 3 overlay graph (= the 07-10 KG design direction above) → Phase 4 wire coverage into this
  machine.

## SPIN-OFF / GENERALISABLE CANDIDATES — surface, don't bury (Dave, 2026-07-05)

*Tools/methods that may generalise — treat like company spin-offs. Surface mid-chat; don't force it.
Memory `spin-off-candidates`. Sibling register for ideas/side-quests: `_FUTURE-STATE.md`.*

- **🌱 The state machine** (`_LIVE-STATE` + `_FUTURE-STATE` + `_DECISION-HISTORY` + decision-audit
  method) — **Dave's first named candidate.** A portable "how a long-running agent project retains
  state, records supersession, and audits its own decisions" kit.
- **🌱 The FONT AUDIT instrument** (2026-07-18, `reviews/gen_univers_dossier.py` + fontTools passes):
  answers "is this face tight or loose relative to its own stroke weight; is our commissioned cut
  actually stock?" with numbers. Settled in ten minutes a weeks-open question and relocated a defect
  to the foundry (ds-004). Unruled; embedded in a dossier generator, would need extracting.
- **🌱 REAL-FONT EMBEDDING for review sheets** (2026-07-18, `embed_fonts()` in
  `gen_tracking_contact_sheet.py`): base64 woff2 inlining so specimens render in the brand face
  anywhere. Retired the "judge on your screen" caveat. **Candidate to fold into `_make_review.py`.**
- Other candidates (unruled): decision-audit runbook · fixed/flex charter pattern ·
  ingestion→overlay-KG method · review-dossier language-review instrument ·
  verification=enforcement gate-tiering · the cockroach-doc pattern. Precedent:
  `digital-experience-transformation`, `graphify-tool`.

- **Capture ritual** — canonical at `knowledge/_RUNBOOK-capture-ritual.md`; run every session, no
  exceptions. The enforcing `_capture_gate.py` is deferred to the PM-KG MVP.
