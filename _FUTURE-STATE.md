# _FUTURE-STATE — the forward ledger

> STANDING: side-quests, feature ideas, and resurrection candidates — the future half of the state
> machine. Read alongside `_LIVE-STATE.md` (what's true now) and `_DECISION-HISTORY/` (how we got here).

*Created 2026-07-18 at Dave's ask during the consolidation review: "how do we store all the ideas for
side-quests, features and ideas that I want to hold onto, so we have a future-state-machine." Division
of labour: **`_LIVE-STATE` keeps in-flight TARGETS (ruled 2026-07-05) and the SPIN-OFF register (ruled
"surface, don't bury")** — this file holds everything forward-looking that is NOT in flight. An idea
graduates OUT of here into `_LIVE-STATE` OPEN/TARGET when work starts. Refresh with the capture ritual.*

**Entry format:** what · why it's held · what it feeds (Apollo phase/mode) · source/provenance pointer ·
status (`idea` / `parked` / `resurrection-candidate` / `graduated→LIVE`).

## Resurrection candidates — experiments to re-evaluate once the factory is built

- **The restyle saga + generate-then-normalise lineage** — the two-pass "generate free → constrain +
  verify" experiments and the ungoverned diagnostic pieces. *Why held:* Dave 2026-07-18: "definitely
  going to revisit all the old ideas and experiments… this one might fit into two of the four modes."
  *Feeds:* **Apollo Create — Creative and Explore modes.** *Source:*
  `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-05-register-spread-and-restyle.md` + `knowledge/_fitness-test/register-spread-2026-07-05*/`
  + memory `generation-mechanism-ideas`. *Status:* resurrection-candidate.
- **The §9 tuning questions** (rule-crafting, inference tiering, the three-arm experiment) — parked by
  the 07-10 ruling until the substrate is rich enough. *Why held:* "I can tune a machine if it doesn't
  have all the parts" — the factory comes first, the tuning returns. *Feeds:* Create mode dials /
  register ramp. *Source:* `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-07-s9-root-cause-and-ruling.md` +
  `knowledge/_FINDINGS-s9-session-2026-07-07.md`. *Status:* resurrection-candidate.
- **Masthead design revisit** — shipped as an **MLP** (Dave, 2026-07-18); iteration expected across
  much of what we produce. *Feeds:* Craft phase. *Source:*
  `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-masthead-rounds.md`. *Status:* parked.
- **Iteration-machine front-end mock** — vision facade, proves alignment only. *Feeds:* the eventual
  Apollo interface/harness. *Source:* `notes/_VISION-iteration-machine_2026-07-03.html` (carries the
  old looks-language — reconcile before reuse, see `_LIVE-STATE` propagation gap). *Status:* parked.
- **Portfolio-interactions craft pass** — the wow pass on the Reorder testbed; don't gold-plate before
  the ask. *Feeds:* Craft. *Source:* memory `portfolio-interactions-invite`. *Status:* idea.

## Side-quests (captured in `_LIVE-STATE` 07-16, now homed here)

- **Research knowledge-graph** — KG over the research corpus (dataviz desk research, nav catalog,
  masthead model, dossiers) so findings are queryable, not stranded. Harvest later; capture
  KG-friendly as we go. *Feeds:* Discover phase / ADR-0007 direction. *Status:* parked.
- **Swiss HTML viewer for the state ledgers** — a rendered, ideally editable face over
  `_LIVE-STATE`/this file, house style. Pairs with the PM-KG direction. *Status:* parked.
- **DataViz method → colleague presentation** — Dave 2026-07-18: "much of it deserves to be a
  presentation to colleagues." Material: the method dossier + V7 sheet + the vibration rule story.
  *Feeds:* Dispatch/advocacy. *Source:* `_DECISION-HISTORY/2026-07-16-dataviz-v7-arc.md`. *Status:* idea.

## Feature ideas (product, not yet specced)

- **Tiered access to canon commits** — DS-admin → domain-admin → standard; sandbox open to all,
  commits tiered (Dave, 07-05; captured in the derivation-governance amend thread). *Feeds:*
  governance layer. *Status:* idea — set the goal first, the access model falls out.
- **Admin settings surface above the per-mode tier dials** — "non-removable = locked, not hardcoded"
  (Dave, 07-17). *Feeds:* the harness. *Status:* idea.
- **Review-overlay upgrades as product** — row-identity capture (the method debt), image paste,
  dictation, export. *Feeds:* Craft phase — the overlay IS the product surface. *Status:* idea,
  method-debt half already logged in `_LIVE-STATE` OPEN.

- **Blast-radius gate v2 — cascade-aware.** T-D13's gate matches selectors structurally
  (class/element presence per file) and gates on the file *set*, so a same-count file *swap* inside
  an acknowledged radius passes, and it doesn't reason about real cascade/specificity. The rigorous
  version parses each file's own CSS and detects genuine size/weight COLLISIONS (the `.tag` 14-vs-12
  case) rather than proxying via file membership. *Feeds:* the type-binding guard-rail. *Status:*
  idea — promote once the v1 has bedded in (cf. consult tool's fuzzy→rigorous path).

- **Harmonise specimen-chrome section labels onto `.spec-h`.** Reference-file section labels are
  inconsistent: List-items + Status-indicator now use `.spec-h` (14px, via the caption composite),
  while older files hardcode `h2{font-size:12px; opacity:.55}`. A pass could move all specimen chrome
  onto one `.spec-h` treatment — but note this is a *visible* change (12→14px + the muting), not a
  no-op, and it's demo scaffolding, not product. *Feeds:* the type-binding tidy / T-D13 follow-on.
  *Status:* idea — surfaced 2026-07-18 during the h2 burndown; decide treatment before sweeping.

## Standing register elsewhere (pointers, not copies)

- **In-flight targets** — gates-as-a-service · chat-to-KB bot · ingestion done-right: `_LIVE-STATE.md`
  → PLANNED / TARGET STATES.
- **Spin-off / generalisable candidates** — state machine kit · font-audit instrument · real-font
  embedding · cockroach-doc pattern: `_LIVE-STATE.md` → SPIN-OFF section (ruled home).
- **Fable-session candidates** — `notes/_FABLE-BRIEF-consolidation.md` §7 (gate-glob audit, decision
  audit runs, KB structure).
